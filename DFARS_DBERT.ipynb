DoD components may request DPC-led\\npeer reviews for acquisitions valued below the $1 billion threshold. DPC will conduct these reviews upon approval by the\\nDirector, Defense Pricing and Contracting (Contract Policy).]\\n(ii) DPC will conduct the preaward peer reviews for noncompetitive procurements prior to the two phases of the\\nacquisition (see (b))] for contract actions, e.g., new contracts, modifications to existing contracts, requests for equitable\\nadjustment, claims valued at $1 billion or more, or for any other contract action USD(A&S) designates as requiring a peer\\nreview regardless of value. DoD components may request DPC-led peer reviews for contract actions valued below the $1\\nbillion threshold. DPC will conduct these reviews upon approval by the Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting (Price,\\nCost and Finance).\\n(iii) Use the following criteria to identify actions that are subject to peer review (see also FAR 1.108(c), Dollar\\nthresholds):\\n(A) If the not-to-exceed amount for an undefinitized contract action or an unpriced change order exceeds the\\npeer review threshold, then the resultant definitization modification(s) will be subject to peer review regardless of actual\\nperformance up to the point of definitization.\\n(B) For indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts that will establish pricing terms that apply to\\norders, use the total maximum dollar value for purposes of the peer review threshold. IDIQ contracts that will not establish\\npricing terms in the basic contract are not subject to peer review, but individual orders that exceed the threshold are subject to\\npeer review.\\n(C) For noncompetitive contract actions, use the greater of the following when considering the firm requirement\\nfor all supplies or services:\\n(1) The approved Government objective amount.\\n(2) The contractor proposed amount.\\n(2) To facilitate planning for peer reviews, the military departments and defense agencies shall provide a rolling\\nannual forecast of acquisitions that will be subject to DPC peer reviews at the end of each quarter (i.e., March 31; June 30;\\nSeptember 30; December 31).\\n(i) Military departments and defense agencies shall submit quarterly forecasts for competitive peer reviews to the\\nDirector, Defense Pricing and Contracting (Contract Policy), at osd.pentagon.ousd-a-s.mbx.dpc-cp@mail.mil.\\n(ii) Military departments and defense agencies shall submit quarterly forecasts for noncompetitive peer reviews to\\nthe Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting (Price, Cost and Finance), at osd.pentagon.ousd-a-s.mbx.dpc-pcf@mail.mil\\n(b) Component peer reviews.

Information\\non determining when a clause requires publication in the Federal Register and approval in accordance with 201.304 (1) is\\nprovided at PGI 201.301 (b).\\n201.303 Publication and codification.\\n(a)(i) The DFARS is codified under chapter 2 in Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations.\\n(ii) To the extent possible, all DFARS text (whether implemental or supplemental) is numbered as if it were\\nimplemental. Supplemental numbering is used only when the text cannot be integrated intelligibly with its FAR counterpart.\\n(A) Implemental numbering is the same as its FAR counterpart, except when the text exceeds one paragraph,\\nthe subdivisions are numbered by skipping a unit in the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence. For example,\\nthree paragraphs implementing FAR 19.501 would be numbered 219.501(1), (2), and (3) rather than (a), (b), and (c). Three\\nparagraphs implementing FAR 19.501(a) would be numbered 219.501(a)(i), (ii), and (iii) rather than (a)(1), (2), and (3).\\nFurther subdivision of the paragraphs follows the prescribed numbering sequence, e.g., 219.501(1)(i)(A)(1)(i).\\n(B) Supplemental numbering is the same as its FAR counterpart, with the addition of a number of 70 and up\\nor (S-70) and up. Parts, subparts, sections, or subsections are supplemented by the addition of a number of 70 and up.\\nLower divisions are supplemented by the addition of a number of (S-70) and up. When text exceeds one paragraph, the\\nsubdivisions are numbered using the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed sequence, without skipping a unit. For example, DFARS\\ntext supplementing FAR 19.501 would be numbered 219.501-70. Its subdivisions would be numbered 219.501-70(a), (b), and\\n(c).\\n(C) Subdivision numbering below the 4th level does not repeat the numbering sequence. It uses italicized Arabic\\nnumbers and then italicized lower case Roman numerals.\\n(D) An example of DFARS numbering is in Table 1-1, DFARS Numbering.\\n(iii) Department/agency and component supplements must parallel the FAR and DFARS numbering, except\\ndepartment/agency supplemental numbering uses subsection numbering of 90 and up, instead of 70 and up.\\nTABLE 1-1, DFARS NUMBERING\\nFAR\\nIs Implemented As\\nIs Supplemented As\\n19\\n219\\n219.70\\n19.5\\n219.5\\n219.570\\n19.501\\n219.501\\n219.501-70\\n19.501-1\\n219.501-1\\n219.501-1-70\\n19.501-1(a)\\n219.501-1(a)\\n219.501-1(a)(S-70)\\n201.3-1\\n\\n201.304\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\nTABLE 1-1, DFARS NUMBERING\\n19.501-1(a)(1)\\n219.501-1(a)(1)\\n219.501-1(a)(1)(S-70)\\n201.304 Agency control and compliance procedures.\\nDepartments and agencies and their component organizations may issue acquisition regulations as necessary to implement\\nor supplement the FAR or DFARS.\\n(1)(i) Approval of the USD(A&S) is required before including in a department/agency or component supplement, or\\nany other contracting regulation document such as a policy letter or clause book, any policy, procedure, clause, or form that—\\n(A) Has a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency; or\\n(B) Has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors.\\n(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this section, the USD(A&S) has delegated authority to the Principal\\nDirector of Defense Pricing and Contracting (DPC) to approve or disapprove the policies, procedures, clauses, and forms\\nsubject to paragraph (1)(i) of this section.\\n(2) In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1304, a new requirement for a certification by a contractor or offeror may not be\\nincluded in a department/agency or component procurement regulation unless—\\n(i) The certification requirement is specifically imposed by statute; or\\n(ii) Written justification for such certification is provided to the Secretary of Defense by USD(A&S), and the\\nSecretary of Defense approves in writing the inclusion of such certification requirement.\\n(3) Contracting activities must obtain the appropriate approval (see 201.404 ) for any class deviation (as defined in FAR\\nSubpart 1.4) from the FAR or DFARS, before its inclusion in a department/agency or component supplement or any other\\ncontracting regulation document such as a policy letter or clause book.\\n(4) Each department and agency must develop and, upon approval by OUSD(A&S)DPC, implement, maintain, and\\ncomply with a plan for controlling the use of clauses other than those prescribed by FAR or DFARS.

The\\nterm shall not be used to refer to any other kind of attachment to a contract. The DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements\\nList, is always an exhibit, rather than an attachment.\\n“Nonseverable deliverable,” as used in this subpart, means a deliverable item that is a single end product or undertaking,\\nentire in nature, that cannot be feasibly subdivided into discrete elements or phases without losing its identity.\\n“Undefinitized item,” as used in this subpart, means an item for which a price has not been established in the basic\\ncontract or by modification.\\n204.7102 Policy.\\n(a) The numbering procedures of this subpart shall apply to all—\\n(1) Solicitations;\\n(2) Solicitation line and subline item numbers;\\n(3) Contracts as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1;\\n(4) Contract line and subline item numbers;\\n(5) Exhibits;\\n(6) Exhibit line items; and\\n(7) Any other document expected to become part of the contract.\\n(b) The numbering procedures are mandatory for all contracts where separate contract line item numbers are assigned,\\nunless—\\n(1) The contract is an indefinite-delivery type for petroleum products against which posts, camps, and stations issue\\ndelivery orders for products to be consumed by them; or\\n(2) The contract is a communications service authorization issued by the Defense Information Systems Agency\\'s\\nDefense Information Technology Contracting Organization.\\n204.7103 Contract line items.\\nFollow the procedures at PGI 204.7103 for establishing contract line items.\\n204.7103-1 Criteria for establishing.\\nContracts shall identify the items or services to be acquired as separate contract line items unless it is not feasible to do so.\\n(a) Contract line items shall have all four of the following characteristics; however, there are exceptions within the\\ncharacteristics, which may make establishing a separate contract line item appropriate even though one of the characteristics\\nappears to be missing—\\n(1) Single unit price. The item shall have a single unit price or a single total price, except—\\n(i) If the item is not separately priced (NSP) but the price is included in the unit price of another contract line item,\\nenter NSP instead of the unit price;\\n(ii) When there are associated subline items, established for other than informational reasons, and those subline\\nitems are priced in accordance with 204.7104 ;\\n(iii) When the items or services are being acquired on a cost-reimbursement contract;\\n(iv) When the contract is for maintenance and repair services (e.g., a labor hour contract) and firm prices have been\\nestablished for elements of the total price of an item but the actual number and quantity of the elements are not known until\\n204.71-1\\n\\n204.7103-1\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\nperformance. The contracting officer may structure these contracts to reflect a firm or estimated total amount for each line\\nitem;\\n(v) When the contract line item is established to refer to an exhibit or an attachment (if management needs dictate\\nthat a unit price be entered, the price shall be set forth in the item description block and enclosed in parentheses); or\\n(vi) When the contract is an indefinite delivery type contract and provides that the price of an item shall be\\ndetermined at the time a delivery order is placed and the price is influenced by such factors as the quantity ordered (e.g.,\\n10-99 @ $1.00, 100-249 @ $.98, 250+ @ $.95), the destination, the FOB point, or the type of packaging required.\\n(2) Separately identifiable. A contract line item must be identified separately from any other items or services on the\\ncontract.\\n(i) Supplies are separately identifiable if they have no more than one—\\n(A) National stock number (NSN);\\n(B) Item description; or\\n(C) Manufacturer\\'s part number.\\n(ii) Services are separately identifiable if they have no more than one—\\n(A) Scope of work; or\\n(B) Description of services.\\n(iii) This requirement does not apply if there are associated subline items, established for other than informational\\nreasons, and those subline items include the actual detailed identification in accordance with 204.7104 . Where this exception\\napplies, use a general narrative description instead of the contract item description.\\n(3) Separate delivery schedule. Each contract line item or service shall have its own delivery schedule, period of\\nperformance, or completion date expressly stated (“as required” constitutes an expressly stated delivery term).\\n(i) The fact that there is more than one delivery date, destination, performance date, or performance point may be a\\ndetermining factor in the decision as to whether to establish more than one contract line item.\\n(ii) If a contract line item has more than one destination or delivery date, the contracting officer may create\\nindividual contract line items for the different destinations or delivery dates, or may specify the different delivery dates for\\nthe units by destination in the delivery schedule.\\n(4) Single accounting classification citation.\\n(i) Each contract line item shall reference a single accounting classification citation except as provided in paragraph\\n(a)(4)(ii) of this subsection.\\n(ii) The use of multiple accounting classification citations for a contract line item is authorized in the following\\nsituations:\\n(A) A single, nonseverable deliverable to be paid for with R&D or other funds properly incrementally obligated\\nover several fiscal years in accordance with DoD policy;\\n(B) A single, nonseverable deliverable to be paid for with different authorizations or appropriations, such as\\nin the acquisition of a satellite or the modification of production tooling used to produce items being acquired by several\\nactivities; or\\n(C) A modification to an existing contract line item for a nonseverable deliverable that results in the delivery of a\\nmodified item(s) where the item(s) and modification are to be paid for with different accounting classification citations.\\n(iii) When the use of multiple accounting classification citations is authorized for a single contract line item,\\nestablish informational subline items for each accounting classification citation in accordance with 204.7105 .\\n(b) All subline items and exhibit line items under one contract line item shall be the same contract type as the contract line\\nitem.\\n(c) For a contract that contains a combination of fixed-price line items, time-and-materials/labor-hour line items, and/or\\ncost-reimbursement line items, identify the contract type for each contract line item in Section B, Supplies or Services and\\nPrices/Costs, to facilitate appropriate payment.\\n(d) Exhibits may be used as an alternative to putting a long list of contract line items in the schedule. If exhibits are used,\\ncreate a contract line item citing the exhibit\\'s identifier. See 204.7105.\\n(e) If the contract involves a test model or a first article which must be approved, establish a separate contract line item\\nor subline item for each item of supply or service which must be approved. If the test model or first article consists of a lot\\ncomposed of a mixture of items, a single line item or subline item may be used for the lot.\\n(f) If a supply or service involves ancillary functions, like packaging and handling, transportation, payment of state or\\nlocal taxes, or use of reusable containers, and these functions are normally performed by the contractor and the contractor\\nis normally entitled to reimbursement for performing these functions, do not establish a separate contract line item solely to\\n204.71-2\\n\\nSUBPART 204.71 - UNIFORM CONTRACT LINE ITEM NUMBERING SYSTEM\\n204.7104-1\\naccount for these functions. However, do identify the functions in the contract schedule. If the offeror separately prices these\\nfunctions, contracting officers may establish separate contract line items for the functions; however, the separate line items\\nmust conform to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection.\\n(g) Certain commercial products and initial provisioning spares for weapons systems are requested and subsequently\\nsolicited using units of measure such as kit, set, or lot. However, there are times when individual items within that kit, set, or\\nlot are not grouped and delivered in a single shipment. This creates potential contract administration issues with inspection,\\nacceptance, and payment. In such cases, solicitations should be structured to allow offerors to provide information about\\nproducts that may not have been known to the Government prior to solicitation and propose an alternate line item structure\\nas long as the alternate is consistent with the requirements of 204.71, which provides explicit guidance on the use of contract\\nline items and subline items, and with PGI 204.71 .\\n204.7103-2 Numbering procedures.\\nFollow the procedures at PGI 204.7103-2 for numbering contract line items.\\n204.7104 Contract subline items.\\n204.7104-1 Criteria for establishing.\\nContract subline items provide flexibility to further identify elements within a contract line item for tracking performance\\nor simplifying administration. There are only two kinds of subline items: those which are informational in nature and those\\nwhich consist of more than one item that requires separate identification.\\n(a) Informational subline items.\\n(1) This type of subline item identifies information that relates directly to the contract line item and is an integral part\\nof it (e.g., parts of an assembly or parts of a kit). These subline items shall not be scheduled separately for delivery, identified\\nseparately for shipment or performance, or priced separately for payment purposes.\\n(2) The informational subline item may include quantities, prices, or amounts, if necessary to satisfy management\\nrequirements. However, these elements shall be included within the item description in the supplies/services column and\\nenclosed in parentheses to prevent confusing them with quantities, prices, or amounts that have contractual significance. Do\\nnot enter these elements in the quantity and price columns.\\n(3) Informational subline items shall be used to identify each accounting classification citation assigned to a single\\ncontract line item number when use of multiple citations is authorized (see 204.7103-1 (a)(4)(ii)).\\n(b)  Separately identified subline items.\\n(1) Subline items will be used instead of contract line items to facilitate payment, delivery tracking, contract funds\\naccounting, or other management purposes. Such subline items shall be used when items bought under one contract line item\\nnumber—\\n(i) Are to be paid for from more than one accounting classification. A subline item shall be established for the\\nquantity associated with the single accounting classification citation. Establish a line item rather than a subline item if it is\\nlikely that a subline item may be assigned additional accounting classification citations at a later date. Identify the funding as\\ndescribed in 204.7104-1 (a)(3);\\n(ii) Are to be packaged in different sizes, each represented by its own NSN;\\n(iii) Have collateral costs, such as packaging costs, but those costs are not a part of the unit price of the contract line\\nitem;\\n(iv) Have different delivery dates or destinations or requisitions, or a combination of the three; or\\n(v) Identify parts of an assembly or kit which—\\n(A) Have to be separately identified at the time of shipment or performance; and\\n(B) Are separately priced.\\n(2) Each separately identified contract subline item shall have its own—\\n(i) Delivery schedule, period of performance, or completion date;\\n(ii) Unit price or single total price or amount (not separately priced (NSP) is acceptable as an entry for price or\\namount if the price is included in another subline item or a different contract line item). This requirement does not apply—\\n(A) If the subline item was created to refer to an exhibit or an attachment. If management needs dictate that a unit\\nprice be entered, the price shall be set forth in the item description block of the schedule and enclosed in parentheses; or\\n(B) In the case of indefinite delivery contracts described at 204.7103-1 (a)(1)(vi).\\n(iii) Identification (e.g., NSN, item description, manufacturer\\'s part number, scope of work, description of services).\\n204.71-3\\n\\n204.7104-2\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(3) Unit prices and extended amounts.\\n(i) The unit price and total amount for all subline items may be entered at the contract line item number level if the\\nunit price for the subline items is identical. If there is any variation, the subline item unit prices shall be entered at the subline\\nitem level only.\\n(ii) The unit price and extended amounts may be entered at the subline items level.\\n(iii) The two methods in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section shall not be combined in a contract line item.\\n(iv) When the price for items not separately priced is included in the price of another contract line or subline item, it\\nmay be necessary to withhold payment on the priced contract line or subline item until the included line or subline items that\\nare not separately priced have been delivered. See the clause at 252.204-7002 , Payment for Contract Line or Subline Items\\nNot Separately Priced.\\n204.7104-2 Numbering procedures.\\nFollow the procedures at PGI 204.7104-2 for numbering contract subline items.\\n204.7105 Contract exhibits and attachments.\\nFollow the procedures at PGI 204.7105 for use and numbering of contract exhibits and attachments.\\n204.7106 Contract modifications.\\n(a) If new items are added, assign new contract line or subline item numbers or exhibit line item numbers, in accordance\\nwith the procedures established at 204.7103 , 204.7104 , and 204.7105 .\\n(b) Modifications to existing contract line items or exhibit line items.\\n(1) If the modification relates to existing contract line items or exhibit line items, the modification shall refer to those\\nitem numbers.\\n(2) If the contracting officer decides to assign new identifications to existing contract or exhibit line items, the\\nfollowing rules apply—\\n(i) Definitized and undefinitized items.\\n(A) The original line item or subline item number may be used if the modification applies to the total quantity of\\nthe original line item or subline.\\n(B) The original line item or subline item number may be used if the modification makes only minor changes in\\nthe specifications of some of the items ordered on the original line item or subline item and the resulting changes in unit price\\ncan be averaged to provide a new single unit price for the total quantity. If the changes in the specifications make the item\\nsignificantly distinguishable from the original item or the resulting changes in unit price cannot be averaged, create a new line\\nitem.\\n(C) If the modification affects only a partial quantity of an existing contract line item or subline item or exhibit\\nline item and the change does not involve either the delivery date or the ship-to/mark-for data, the original contract line item\\nor subline item or exhibit line item number shall remain with the unchanged quantity. Assign the changed quantity the next\\navailable number.\\n(ii) Undefinitized items. In addition to the rules in paragraph (b)(2)(i), the following additional rules apply to\\nundefinitized items—\\n(A) If the modification is undefinitized and increases the quantity of an existing definitized item, assign the\\nundefinitized quantity the next available number.\\n(B) If the modification increases the quantity of an existing undefinitized item, the original contract line item\\nor subline item or exhibit line item may be used if the unit price for the new quantity is expected to be the same as the price\\nfor the original quantity. If the unit prices of the two quantities will be different, assign the new quantity the next available\\nnumber.\\n(C) If the modification both affects only a partial quantity of the existing contract line item or subline item or\\nexhibit line item and definitizes the price for the affected portion, the definitized portion shall retain the original item number.\\nIf there is any undefinitized portion of the item, assign it the next available number. However, if the modification definitizes\\nthe price for the whole quantity of the line item, and price impact of the changed work can be apportioned equally over the\\nwhole to arrive at a new unit price, the quantity with the changes can be added into the quantity of the existing item.\\n(D) If the modification affects only a partial quantity of an existing contract line item or subline item or exhibit\\nline item, but does not change the delivery schedule or definitize price, the unchanged portion shall retain the original\\ncontract line item or subline item or exhibit line item number. Assign the changed portion the next available number.\\n204.71-4\\n\\nSUBPART 204.71 - UNIFORM CONTRACT LINE ITEM NUMBERING SYSTEM\\n204.7109\\n(3) If the modification will decrease the amount obligated—\\n(i) There shall be coordination between the administrative and procuring contracting offices before issuance of the\\nmodification; and\\n(ii) The contracting officer shall not issue the modification unless sufficient unliquidated obligation exists or the\\npurpose is to recover monies owed to the Government.\\n204.7107 Contract accounting classification reference number (ACRN) and agency accounting identifier (AAI).\\nTraceability of funds from accounting systems to contract actions is accomplished using ACRNs and AAIs.

Acquisition management normally\\nincludes computing requirements, funding, budgeting, storing, issuing, cataloging, standardizing, and contracting functions.\\n“Requiring department” means the department or agency which has the requirement for an item.\\n208.7002 Assignment authority.\\n(a) Under the DoD Coordinated Acquisition Program, contracting responsibility for certain commodities is assigned to a\\nsingle department, agency, or the General Services Administration (GSA). Commodity assignments are made—\\n(1) To the departments and agencies, by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Logistics);\\n(2) To GSA, through agreement with GSA, by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Logistics);\\n(3) Outside the contiguous United States, by the Unified Commanders; and\\n(4) For acquisitions to be made in the contiguous United States for commodities not assigned under paragraphs (a)(1),\\n(2), or (3) of this section, by agreement of agency heads (10 U.S.C. 3065).\\n(i) Agreement may be on either a one-time or a continuing basis. The submission of a military interdepartmental\\npurchase request (MIPR) by a requiring activity and its acceptance by the contracting activity of another department, even\\nthough based on an oral communication, constitutes a one-time agreement.\\n(ii) Consider repetitive delegated acquisition responsibilities for coordinated acquisition assignment. If not\\nconsidered suitable for coordinated acquisition assignment, formalize continuing agreements and distribute them to all\\nactivities concerned.\\n(b) Under the Integrated Materiel Management Program, assignments are made by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of\\nDefense (Logistics)—\\n(1) To the departments and agencies; and\\n(2) To GSA, through agreement with GSA.\\n208.7002-1 Acquiring department responsibilities.\\nSee PGI 208.7002-1 for the acquiring department’s responsibilities.\\n208.7002-2 Requiring department responsibilities.\\nSee PGI 208.7002-2 for the requiring department’s responsibilities.\\n208.7003 Applicability.\\n208.7003-1 Assignments under integrated materiel management (IMM).\\n(a) Acquire all items assigned for IMM from the IMM manager except—\\n(1) Items purchased under circumstances of unusual and compelling urgency as defined in FAR 6.302-2. After such\\na purchase is made, the requiring activity must send one copy of the contract and a statement of the emergency to the IMM\\nmanager;\\n(2) Items for which the IMM manager assigns a supply system code for local purchase or otherwise grants authority to\\npurchase locally; or\\n208.70-1\\n\\n208.7003-2\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(3) When purchase by the requiring activity is in the best interest of the Government in terms of the combination of\\nquality, timeliness, and cost that best meets the requirement. This exception does not apply to items—\\n(i) Critical to the safe operation of a weapon system;\\n(ii) With special security characteristics; or\\n(iii) Which are dangerous (e.g., explosives, munitions).\\n(b) Follow the procedures at PGI 208.7003-1 (b) when an item assigned for IMM is to be acquired by the requiring\\ndepartment in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this subsection.\\n208.7003-2 Assignments under coordinated acquisition.\\nRequiring departments must submit to the acquiring department all contracting requirements for items assigned for\\ncoordinated acquisition, except—\\n(a) Items obtained through the sources in FAR 8.002(a)(1)(i) through (vii);\\n(b) Items obtained under 208.7003-1 (a);\\n(c) Requirements not in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold in FAR Part 2, when contracting by the requiring\\ndepartment is in the best interest of the Government;\\n(d) In an emergency. When an emergency purchase is made, the requiring department must send one copy of the contract\\nand a statement of the emergency to the contracting activity of the acquiring department;\\n(e) Requirements for which the acquiring department\\'s contracting activity delegates contracting authority to the requiring\\ndepartment;\\n(f) Items in a research and development stage (as described in FAR Part 35). Under this exception, the military\\ndepartments may contract for research and development requirements, including quantities for testing purposes and items\\nundergoing in-service evaluation (not yet in actual production, but beyond prototype). Generally, this exception applies only\\nwhen research and development funds are used.\\n(g) Items peculiar to nuclear ordnance material where design characteristics or test-inspection requirements are controlled\\nby the Department of Energy (DoE) or by DoD to ensure reliability of nuclear weapons.\\n(1) This exception applies to all items designed for and peculiar to nuclear ordnance regardless of agency control, or to\\nany item which requires test or inspection conducted or controlled by DoE or DoD.\\n(2) This exception does not cover items used for both nuclear ordnance and other purposes if the items are not subject\\nto the special testing procedures.\\n(h) Items to be acquired under FAR 6.302-6 (national security requires limitation of sources);\\n(i) Items to be acquired under FAR 6.302-1 (supplies available only from the original source for follow-on contract);\\n(j) Items directly related to a major system and which are design controlled by and acquired from either the system\\nmanufacturer or a manufacturer of a major subsystem;\\n(k) Items subject to rapid design changes, or to continuous redesign or modification during the production and/or\\noperational use phases, which require continual contact between industry and the requiring department to ensure that the item\\nmeets the requirements:\\n(1) This exception permits the requiring department to contract for items of highly unstable design. For use of\\nthis exception, it must be clearly impractical, both technically and contractually, to refer the acquisition to the acquiring\\ndepartment. Anticipation that contracting by negotiation will be appropriate, or that a number of design changes may occur\\nduring contract performance is not in itself sufficient reason for using this exception.\\n(2) This exception also applies to items requiring compatibility testing, provided such testing requires continual contact\\nbetween industry and the requiring department;\\n(l) Containers acquired only with items for which they are designed;\\n(m) One-time buy of a noncataloged item.\\n(1) This exception permits the requiring departments to contract for a nonrecurring requirement for a noncataloged\\nitem. This exception could cover a part or component for a prototype which may be stock numbered at a later date.\\n(2) This exception does not permit acquisitions of recurring requirements for an item, based solely on the fact that\\nthe item is not stock numbered, nor may it be used to acquire items which have only slightly different characteristics than\\npreviously cataloged items.\\n208.7004 Procedures.\\nFollow the procedures at PGI 208.7004 for processing coordinated acquisition requirements.\\n208.70-2\\n\\nSUBPART 208.70 - COORDINATED ACQUISITION\\n208.7006\\n208.7005 Military interdepartmental purchase requests.\\nFollow the procedures at—\\n(a) PGI 253.208-1 when using DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request; and\\n(b) PGI 253.208-2 when using DD Form 448-2, Acceptance of MIPR.\\n208.7006 Coordinated acquisition assignments.\\nSee PGI 208.7006 for coordinated acquisition assignments.\\n208.70-3\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n208.70-4\\n\\nSUBPART 208.71 - ACQUISITION FOR NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA)\\n208.7102\\nSubpart 208.71 - ACQUISITION FOR NATIONAL\\nAERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA)\\n208.7100 Authorization.\\nNASA is authorized by Pub.

The review shall include, at a minimum, contacting\\nknowledgeable individuals in Government and industry regarding existing market capabilities and pricing information, and\\nmay include any of the techniques for conducting market research provided in FAR 10.002(b)(2) (section 855 of the National\\nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Pub. L. 114-92)).\\nSubpart 212.1 - ACQUISITION OF COMMERCIAL\\nPRODUCTS AND COMMERCIAL SERVICES\\n212.102 Applicability.\\n(a)(i) Use of FAR part 12 procedures. Use of FAR part 12 procedures is based on—\\n(A) A determination that an item is a commercial product or commercial service (see paragraph (a)(iii) of this\\nsection); or\\n(B) Applicability of one of the following statutes that provide for treatment as a commercial product or\\ncommercial service and use of FAR part 12 procedures, even though the item may not meet the definition of “commercial\\nproduct” or “commercial service” at FAR 2.101 and does not require a commercial product or commercial service\\ndetermination:\\n(1) 41 U.S.C. 1903 - Supplies or services to be used to facilitate defense against or recovery from cyber,\\nnuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack pursuant to FAR 12.102(f).\\n(2) 10 U.S.C. 3457 - Supplies or services from nontraditional defense contractors pursuant to 212.102 (a)\\n(iv).\\n(3) 10 U.S.C. 3458 – Supplies or services resulting from a commercial solutions opening pursuant to\\nsubpart 212.70.\\n(ii) Prior use of FAR part 12 procedures.\\n(A) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 3456(c), except as provided in paragraph (a)(ii)(B) of this section or unless the\\nitem was acquired pursuant to paragraph (a)(i)(B) of this section, if the Commercial Item Database (for website see PGI\\n212.102(a)(iii)(A)(1)) contains a prior commerciality determination, or the contracting officer has other evidence that an\\nitem has previously been acquired by DoD using commercial product and commercial service acquisition procedures under\\nFAR part 12, then the prior contract shall serve as a prior determination that an item is a commercial product or commercial\\nservice. The contracting officer shall document the file accordingly.\\n(B)(1) If the item to be acquired meets the criteria in paragraph (a)(ii)(A) of this section, the item may not\\nbe acquired using other than FAR part 12 procedures unless the head of the contracting activity issues a determination as\\nspecified in paragraph (a)(ii)(B)(2)(ii) of this section.\\n(2) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 3703(d)(1), the contracting officer may presume that a prior commercial product\\nor commercial service determination made by a military department, a defense agency, or another component of DoD shall\\nserve as a determination for subsequent procurements of such item. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3703(d) and 10 U.S.C.\\n3456(c), if the contracting officer questions a prior determination to use FAR part 12 procedures and instead chooses to\\nproceed with a procurement of an item previously determined to be a commercial product and commercial service using\\nprocedures other than FAR part 12 procedures, the contracting officer shall request a review by the head of the contracting\\nactivity that will conduct the procurement. Not later than 30 days after receiving a request for review, the head of the\\ncontracting activity shall—\\n(i) Confirm that the prior use of FAR part 12 procedures was appropriate and still applicable; or\\n(ii) Issue a determination that the prior use of FAR part 12 procedures was improper or that it is\\nno longer appropriate to acquire the item using FAR part 12 procedures, with a written explanation of the basis for the\\ndetermination.\\n(iii) Commercial product or commercial service determination. Unless the procedures in paragraph (a)(ii) of this\\nsection are applicable, when using FAR part 12 procedures for acquisitions of commercial products and commercial services\\npursuant to 212.102(a)(i)(A) that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold , the contracting officer shall—\\n(A) Determine in writing that the acquisition meets the \"commercial product\" or \"commercial service\" definition\\nin FAR 2.101;\\n(B) Include the written determination in the contract file; and\\n212.1-1\\n\\n212.102\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(C) Obtain approval at one level above the contracting officer when a commercial product or commercial service\\ndetermination relies on paragraphs (1)(ii), (3), or (4), or (6) of the “commercial product” definition at FAR 2.101 or paragraph\\n(2) of the \"commercial service\" definition at FAR 2.101; and\\n(D) Follow the procedures and guidance at PGI 212.102 (a)(iii) regarding file documentation and commercial\\nproduct or commercial service determinations.\\n(iv) Nontraditional defense contractors. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3457, contracting officers—\\n(A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(iv)(B) of this section, may treat supplies and services provided by\\nnontraditional defense contractors as commercial products or commercial services. This permissive authority is intended to\\nenhance defense innovation and investment, enable DoD to acquire items that otherwise might not have been available, and\\ncreate incentives for nontraditional defense contractors to do business with DoD. It is not intended to recategorize current\\nnoncommercial other than commercial products or commercial services; however, when appropriate, contracting officers may\\nconsider applying commercial product or commercial service procedures to the procurement of supplies and services from\\nbusiness segments that meet the definition of “nontraditional defense contractor” even though they have been established\\nunder traditional defense contractors. The decision to apply commercial product and commercial service procedures to the\\nprocurement of supplies and services from nontraditional defense contractors does not require a commercial product or\\ncommercial service determination and does not mean the item is commercial;\\n(B) Shall treat services provided by a business unit that is a nontraditional defense contractor as commercial\\nservices, to the extent that such services use the same pool of employees as used for commercial customers and are priced\\nusing methodology similar to methodology used for commercial pricing; and\\n(C) Shall document the file when treating supplies or services from a nontraditional defense contractor as\\ncommercial products or commercial services in accordance with paragraph (a)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section.\\n(v) Commercial item guidebook.

If the contracting officer determines that the\\npricing information submitted is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer may request\\nother relevant information regarding the basis for price or cost, including uncertified cost data such as labor costs, material\\ncosts, and other direct and indirect costs.\\n212.211 Technical data.\\nThe DoD policy for acquiring technical data for commercial products or commercial services is at 227.7102 .\\n212.212 Computer software.\\n(1) Departments and agencies shall identify and evaluate, at all stages of the acquisition process (including concept\\nrefinement, concept decision, and technology development), opportunities for the use of commercial computer software and\\nother non-developmental software in accordance with Section 803 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year\\n2009 (Pub.

If there are no obvious high-dollar-value items, include an analysis of a\\nrandom sample of items; and\\n(D) A random sample of the remaining low-dollar value items. Sample size may be determined by subjective\\njudgment, e.g., experience with the offeror and the reliability of its estimating and accounting systems.\\n(b) Price analysis for commercial and noncommercial items.\\n(i) In the absence of adequate price competition in response to the solicitation, pricing based on market prices is the\\npreferred method to establish a fair and reasonable price (see PGI 215.404-1 (b)(i)).\\n(ii) If the contracting officer determines that the information obtained through market research is insufficient\\nto determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall consider information submitted by the offeror of\\nrecent purchase prices paid by the Government and commercial customers for the same or similar commercial products\\nor commercial services under comparable terms and conditions in establishing price reasonableness on a subsequent\\npurchase if the contracting officer is satisfied that the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison.\\nPrice reasonableness shall not be based solely on historical prices paid by the Government (see 215.403-3(a)(1)). The\\ncontracting officer shall consider the totality of other relevant factors such as the time elapsed since the prior purchase and\\nany differences in the quantities purchased ( 10 U.S.C. 3703(e) ).\\n(iii) If the contracting officer determines that the offeror cannot provide sufficient information as described in\\nparagraph (b)(ii) of this section to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer should request the offeror to\\nsubmit information on—\\n(A) Prices paid for the same or similar items sold under different terms and conditions;\\n(B) Prices paid for similar levels of work or effort on related products or services;\\n(C) Prices paid for alternative solutions or approaches; and\\n(D) Other relevant information that can serve as the basis for determining the reasonableness of price.\\n(iv) If the contracting officer determines that the pricing information submitted is not sufficient to determine the\\nreasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall request other relevant information, to include cost data. However, no\\ncost data may be required in any case in which there are sufficient non-Government sales of the same item to establish\\nreasonableness of price (section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Pub. L. 112-239)).\\n(v) When evaluating pricing data, the contracting officer shall consider materially differing terms and conditions,\\nquantities, and market and economic factors (see PGI 215.404-1 Proposal analysis techniques.(b)(v)). For similar items,\\nthe contracting officer shall also consider material differences between the similar item and the item being procured (see\\nFAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii)(B)). Material differences are those that could reasonably be expected to influence the contracting\\nofficer\\'s determination of price reasonableness. The contracting officer shall consider the following factors when evaluating\\nthe relevance of the information available:\\n(A) Market prices.\\n(B) Age of data.\\n(1) Whether data is too old to be relevant depends on the industry (e.g., rapidly evolving technologies),\\nproduct maturity (e.g., stable), economic factors (e.g., new sellers in the marketplace), and various other considerations.\\n(2) A pending sale may be relevant if, in the judgement of the contracting officer, it is probable at the\\nanticipated price, and the sale could reasonably be expected to materially influence the contracting officer’s determination of\\nprice reasonableness. The contracting officer may consult with the cognizant administrative contracting officers (ACOs) as\\nthey may have information about pending sales.\\n(C) Volume and completeness of transaction data. Data must include a sufficient number of transactions to\\nrepresent the range of relevant sales to all types of customers. The data must also include key information, such as date,\\nquantity sold, part number, part nomenclature, sales price, and customer. If the number of transactions is insufficient or the\\ndata is incomplete, the contracting officer shall request additional sales data to evaluate price reasonableness. If the contractor\\ncannot provide sufficient sales data, the contracting officer shall request other relevant information.\\n(D) Nature of transactions. The nature of a sales transaction includes the information necessary to understand\\nthe transaction, such as terms and conditions, date, quantity sold, sale price, unique requirements, the type of customer\\n(government, distributor, retail end-user, etc.), and related agreements. It also includes warranties, key product technical\\nspecifications, maintenance agreements, and preferred customer rewards.\\n(vi) The contracting officer shall consider catalog prices to be reliable when they are regularly maintained and\\nsupported by relevant sales data (including any related discounts, refunds, rebates, offsets, or other adjustments). The\\ncontracting officer may request that the offeror support differences between the proposed price(s), catalog price(s), and\\nrelevant sales data.\\n215.4-7\\n\\n215.404-2\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(vii) The contracting officer may consult with the DoD cadre of experts who are available to provide expert\\nadvice to the acquisition workforce in assisting with commercial product or commercial service determinations and price\\nreasonableness determinations. The DoD cadre of experts is identified at PGI 215.404-1 (b)(vii).\\n(viii) When procuring a service or an end product identified by a material identifier that is available as described at\\n204.7603, the contracting officer shall consider the Supplier Performance Risk System price risk assessments in determining\\nif a proposed price is consistent with historical prices paid for an item or otherwise creates a risk to the Government.

Except for the cost efficiency special factor, each profit factor has a normal value and a designated\\nrange of values. The normal value is representative of average conditions on the prospective contract when compared to\\nall goods and services acquired by DoD. The designated range provides values based on above normal or below normal\\nconditions. In the price negotiation documentation, the contracting officer need not explain assignment of the normal value,\\nbut should address conditions that justify assignment of other than the normal value. The cost efficiency special factor has no\\nnormal value. The contracting officer shall exercise sound business judgment in selecting a value when this special factor is\\nused (see 215.404-71-5).\\n215.404-71-2 Performance risk.\\n(a) Description. This profit factor addresses the contractor\\'s degree of risk in fulfilling the contract requirements. The\\nfactor consists of two parts:\\n(1) Technical - the technical uncertainties of performance.\\n(2) Management/cost control - the degree of management effort necessary -\\n(i) To ensure that contract requirements are met; and\\n(ii) To reduce and control costs.\\n(b) Determination.

Indicators are -\\n(A) Items are being manufactured using specifications with stringent tolerance limits;\\n(B) The efforts require highly skilled personnel or require the use of state-of-the-art machinery;\\n(C) The services and analytical efforts are extremely important to the Government and must be performed to\\nexacting standards;\\n(D) The contractor\\'s independent development and investment has reduced the Government\\'s risk or cost;\\n(E) The contractor has accepted an accelerated delivery schedule to meet DoD requirements; or\\n(F) The contractor has assumed additional risk through warranty provisions.\\n(ii) Extremely complex, vital efforts to overcome difficult technical obstacles that require personnel with exceptional\\nabilities, experience, and professional credentials may justify a value significantly above normal.\\n(iii) The following may justify a maximum value -\\n(A) Development or initial production of a new item, particularly if performance or quality specifications are\\ntight; or\\n(B) A high degree of development or production concurrency.\\n(3) Below normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value in those cases where the\\ntechnical risk is low. Indicators are -\\n(A) Requirements are relatively simple;\\n(B) Technology is not complex;\\n(C) Efforts do not require highly skilled personnel;\\n(D) Efforts are routine;\\n(E) Programs are mature; or\\n(F) Acquisition is a follow-on effort or a repetitive type acquisition.\\n215.4-10\\n\\nSUBPART 215.4 - CONTRACT PRICING\\n215.404-71-2\\n(ii) The contracting officer may assign a value significantly below normal for -\\n(A) Routine services;\\n(B) Production of simple items;\\n(C) Rote entry or routine integration of Government-furnished information; or\\n(D) Simple operations with Government-furnished property.\\n(4) Technology incentive range. (i) The contracting officer may assign values within the technology incentive range\\nwhen contract performance includes the introduction of new, significant technological innovation. Use the technology\\nincentive range only for the most innovative contract efforts. Innovation may be in the form of -\\n(A) Development or application of new technology that fundamentally changes the characteristics of an existing\\nproduct or system and that results in increased technical performance, improved reliability, or reduced costs; or\\n(B) New products or systems that contain significant technological advances over the products or systems they\\nare replacing.\\n(ii) When selecting a value within the technology incentive range, the contracting officer should consider the\\nrelative value of the proposed innovation to the acquisition as a whole. When the innovation represents a minor benefit, the\\ncontracting officer should consider using values less than the norm. For innovative efforts that will have a major positive\\nimpact on the product or program, the contracting officer may use values above the norm.\\n(e) Evaluation criteria for management/cost control. (1) The contracting officer should evaluate -\\n(i) The contractor\\'s management and internal control systems using contracting office data, information and reviews\\nmade by field contract administration offices or other DoD field offices;\\n(ii) The management involvement expected on the prospective contract action;\\n(iii) The degree of cost mix as an indication of the types of resources applied and value added by the contractor;\\n(iv) The contractor\\'s support of Federal socioeconomic programs;\\n(v) The expected reliability of the contractor\\'s cost estimates (including the contractor\\'s cost estimating system);\\n(vi) The adequacy of the contractor\\'s management approach to controlling cost and schedule; and\\n(vii) Any other factors that affect the contractor\\'s ability to meet the cost targets (e.g., foreign currency exchange\\nrates and inflation rates).\\n(2) Above normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign a higher than normal value when there is a high\\ndegree of management effort. Indicators of this are -\\n(A) The contractor\\'s value added is both considerable and reasonably difficult;\\n(B) The effort involves a high degree of integration or coordination;\\n(C) The contractor has a good record of past performance;\\n(D) The contractor has a substantial record of active participation in Federal socioeconomic programs;\\n(E) The contractor provides fully documented and reliable cost estimates;\\n(F) The contractor makes appropriate make-or-buy decisions; or\\n(G) The contractor has a proven record of cost tracking and control.\\n(ii) The contracting officer may justify a maximum value when the effort -\\n(A) Requires large scale integration of the most complex nature;\\n(B) Involves major international activities with significant management coordination (e.g., offsets with foreign\\nvendors); or\\n(C) Has critically important milestones.\\n(iii) If the contractor demonstrates efficient management and cost control through the submittal of a timely,\\nqualifying proposal (as defined in217.7401) in furtherance of definitization of an undefinitized contract action, and the\\nproposal demonstrates effective cost control from the time of award to the present, the contracting officer may add 1\\npercentage point to the value determined for management/cost control up to the maximum of 7 percent.\\n(3) Below normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value when the management\\neffort is minimal. Indicators of this are -\\n(A) The program is mature and many end item deliveries have been made;\\n(B) The contractor adds minimal value to an item;\\n(C) The efforts are routine and require minimal supervision;\\n(D) The contractor provides poor quality, untimely proposals;\\n(E) The contractor fails to provide an adequate analysis of subcontractor costs;\\n(F) The contractor does not cooperate in the evaluation and negotiation of the proposal;\\n(G) The contractor\\'s cost estimating system is marginal;\\n215.4-11\\n\\n215.404-71-3\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(H) The contractor has made minimal effort to initiate cost reduction programs;\\n(I) The contractor\\'s cost proposal is inadequate;\\n(J) The contractor has a record of cost overruns or another indication of unreliable cost estimates and lack of cost\\ncontrol; or\\n(K) The contractor has a poor record of past performance.\\n(ii) The following may justify a value significantly below normal -\\n(A) Reviews performed by the field contract administration offices disclose unsatisfactory management and\\ninternal control systems (e.g., quality assurance, property control, safety, security); or\\n(B) The effort requires an unusually low degree of management involvement.\\n215.404-71-3 Contract type risk and working capital adjustment.\\n(a) Description. The contract type risk factor focuses on the degree of cost risk accepted by the contractor under varying\\ncontract types. The working capital adjustment is an adjustment added to the profit objective for contract type risk. It only\\napplies to fixed-price contracts that provide for progress payments. Though it uses a formula approach, it is not intended to\\nbe an exact calculation of the cost of working capital. Its purpose is to give general recognition to the contractor\\'s cost of\\nworking capital under varying contract circumstances, financing policies, and the economic environment.\\n(b) Determination. The following extract from the DD 1547 is annotated to explain the process.\\nItem\\nContractor risk\\nfactors\\nAssigned value\\nBase\\nProfit objective\\n24a\\nContract Type Risk\\n(based on incurred\\ncosts at the time of\\nqualifying proposal\\nsubmission)\\n(1)\\n(2)(i)\\n(3)\\n24b\\nContract Type Risk\\n(based on Government\\nestimated cost to\\ncomplete)\\n(1)\\n(2)(ii)\\n(3)\\n24c\\nTotals\\n(3)\\n(3)\\nItem\\nContractor risk\\nfactors\\nCosts financed\\nLength factor\\nInterest rate\\nProfit objective\\n25\\nWorking Capital\\n(4)\\n(5)\\n(6)\\n(7)\\n(8)\\n(1) Select a value from the list of contract types in paragraph (c) of this section using the evaluation criteria in\\nparagraph (d) of this section. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section.\\n(2)(i) Insert the amount of costs incurred as of the date the contractor submits a qualifying proposal, such as under an\\nundefinitized contract action, (excluding facilities capital cost of money) into the Block 24a column titled Base.\\n(ii) Insert the amount of Government estimated cost to complete (excluding facilities capital cost of money) into the\\nBlock 24b column titled Base.\\n(3) Multiply (1) by (2)(i) and (2)(ii), respectively for Blocks 24a and 24b.

Do not compute a working capital\\nadjustment.\\n(2) When the contract contains provisions for progress payments, compute a working capital adjustment (Block 25).\\n(3) For the purposes of assigning profit values, treat a fixed-price contract with redetermination provisions as if it were\\na fixed-price incentive contract with below normal conditions.\\n(4) Cost-plus contracts shall not receive the working capital adjustment.\\n(5) These types of contracts are considered cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts for the purposes of assigning profit values.\\nThey shall not receive the working capital adjustment in Block 25. However, they may receive higher than normal values\\nwithin the designated range to the extent that portions of cost are fixed.\\n(6) When the contract contains provisions for performance-based payments, do not compute a working capital\\nadjustment.\\n(d) Evaluation criteria - (1) General. The contracting officer should consider elements that affect contract type risk such\\nas -\\n(i) Length of contract;\\n(ii) Adequacy of cost data for projections;\\n(iii) Economic environment;\\n215.4-13\\n\\n215.404-71-3\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(iv) Nature and extent of subcontracted activity;\\n(v) Protection provided to the contractor under contract provisions (e.g., economic price adjustment clauses);\\n(vi) The ceilings and share lines contained in incentive provisions;\\n(vii) Risks associated with contracts for foreign military sales (FMS) that are not funded by U.S. appropriations; and\\n(viii) When the contract contains provisions for performance-based payments -\\n(A) The frequency of payments;\\n(B) The total amount of payments compared to the maximum allowable amount specified at FAR 32.1004(b)(2);\\nand\\n(C) The risk of the payment schedule to the contractor.\\n(2) Mandatory. (i) The contracting officer shall assess the extent to which costs have been incurred prior to\\ndefinitization of the contract action (also see 217.7404-6(a) and 243.204-70-6). When considering the reduced cost risks\\nassociated with allowable incurred costs on an undefinitized contract action, it is appropriate to apply separate contract\\nrisk factors for allowable incurred costs and estimated costs to complete when completing the contract risk sections of DD\\nForm 1547, Record of Weighted Guidelines. When costs have been incurred prior to definitization, generally regard the\\ncontract type risk to be in the low end of the designated range. If a substantial portion of the costs has been incurred prior\\nto definitization, the contracting officer may assign a value as low as zero percent, regardless of contract type. However, if\\na contractor submits a qualifying proposal to definitize an undefinitized contract action and the contracting officer for such\\naction definitizes the contract after the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the contractor submitted\\nthe qualifying proposal as defined in 217.7401, the profit allowed on the contract shall accurately reflect the cost risk of the\\ncontractor as such risk existed on the date the contractor submitted the qualifying proposal.\\n(ii) Contracting officers shall document in the price negotiation memorandum the reason for assigning a specific\\ncontract type risk value, to include the extent to which any reduced cost risk during the undefinitized period of performance\\nwas considered, in determining the negotiation objective.\\n(3) Above normal conditions. The contracting officer may assign a higher than normal value when there is substantial\\ncontract type risk. Indicators of this are -\\n(i) Efforts where there is minimal cost history;\\n(ii) Long-term contracts without provisions protecting the contractor, particularly when there is considerable\\neconomic uncertainty;\\n(iii) Incentive provisions (e.g., cost and performance incentives) that place a high degree of risk on the contractor;\\n(iv) FMS sales (other than those under DoD cooperative logistics support arrangements or those made from U.S.\\nGovernment inventories or stocks) where the contractor can demonstrate that there are substantial risks above those normally\\npresent in DoD contracts for similar items; or\\n(v) An aggressive performance-based payment schedule that increases risk.\\n(4) Below normal conditions. The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value when the contract type risk\\nis low. Indicators of this are -\\n(i) Very mature product line with extensive cost history;\\n(ii) Relative short-term contracts;\\n(iii) Contractual provisions that substantially reduce the contractor\\'s risk;\\n(iv) Incentive provisions that place a low degree of risk on the contractor;\\n(v) Performance-based payments totaling the maximum allowable amount(s) specified at FAR 32.1004(b)(2); or\\n(vi) A performance-based payment schedule that is routine with minimal risk.\\n(e) Costs financed. (1) Costs financed equal total costs multiplied by the portion (percent) of costs financed by the\\ncontractor.\\n(2) Total costs equal Block 20 (i.e., all allowable costs excluding facilities capital cost of money), reduced as\\nappropriate when -\\n(i) The contractor has little cash investment (e.g., subcontractor progress payments liquidated late in period of\\nperformance);\\n(ii) Some costs are covered by special financing provisions, such as advance payments; or\\n(iii) The contract is multiyear and there are special funding arrangements.\\n(3) The portion that the contractor finances is generally the portion not covered by progress payments, i.e., 100 percent\\nminus the customary progress payment rate (see FAR 32.501). For example, if a contractor receives progress payments\\nat 80 percent, the portion that the contractor finances is 20 percent. On contracts that provide progress payments to small\\nbusinesses, use the customary progress payment rate for large businesses.\\n215.4-14\\n\\nSUBPART 215.4 - CONTRACT PRICING\\n215.404-71-4\\n(f) Contract length factor. (1) This is the period of time that the contractor has a working capital investment in the contract.\\nIt -\\n(i) Is based on the time necessary for the contractor to complete the substantive portion of the work;\\n(ii) Is not necessarily the period of time between contract award and final delivery (or final payment), as periods of\\nminimal effort should be excluded;\\n(iii) Should not include periods of performance contained in option provisions; and\\n(iv) Should not, for multiyear contracts, include periods of performance beyond that required to complete the initial\\nprogram year\\'s requirements.\\n(2) The contracting officer -\\n(i) Should use the following table to select the contract length factor;\\n(ii) Should develop a weighted average contract length when the contract has multiple deliveries; and\\n(iii) May use sampling techniques provided they produce a representative result.\\nTable\\nPeriod to perform substantive portion (in months)\\nContract length factor\\n21 or less\\n.40\\n22 to 27\\n.65\\n28 to 33\\n.90\\n34 to 39\\n1.15\\n40 to 45\\n1.40\\n46 to 51\\n1.65\\n52 to 57\\n1.90\\n58 to 63\\n2.15\\n64 to 69\\n2.40\\n70 to 75\\n2.65\\n76 or more\\n2.90\\n(3) Example: A prospective contract has a performance period of 40 months with end items being delivered in the 34th,\\n36th, 38th, and 40th months of the contract. The average period is 37 months and the contract length factor is 1.15.\\n215.404-71-4 Facilities capital employed.\\n(a) Description. This factor focuses on encouraging and rewarding capital investment in facilities that benefit DoD. It\\nrecognizes both the facilities capital that the contractor will employ in contract performance and the contractor\\'s commitment\\nto improving productivity.\\n(b) Contract facilities capital estimates. The contracting officer shall estimate the facilities capital cost of money and\\ncapital employed using—\\n(1) An analysis of the appropriate Forms CASB-CMF and cost of money factors (48 CFR 9904.414 and FAR\\n31.205-10); and\\n(2) DD Form 1861, Contract Facilities Capital Cost of Money.\\n(c) Use of DD Form 1861. See PGI 215.404-71 -4(c) for obtaining field pricing support for preparing DD Form 1861.\\n(1) Purpose. The DD Form 1861 provides a means of linking the Form CASB-CMF and DD Form 1547, Record of\\nWeighted Guidelines Application. It—\\n(i) Enables the contracting officer to differentiate profit objectives for various types of assets (land, buildings,\\nequipment). The procedure is similar to applying overhead rates to appropriate overhead allocation bases to determine\\ncontract overhead costs.\\n(ii) Is designed to record and compute the contract facilities capital cost of money and capital employed which is\\ncarried forward to DD Form 1547.\\n215.4-15\\n\\n215.404-71-4\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(2) Completion instructions. Complete a DD Form 1861 only after evaluating the contractor\\'s cost proposal,\\nestablishing cost of money factors, and establishing a prenegotiation objective on cost. Complete the form as follows:\\n(i) List overhead pools and direct-charging service centers (if used) in the same structure as they appear on the\\ncontractor\\'s cost proposal and Form CASB-CMF. The structure and allocation base units-of-measure must be compatible on\\nall three displays.\\n(ii) Extract appropriate contract overhead allocation base data, by year, from the evaluated cost breakdown or\\nprenegotiation cost objective and list against each overhead pool and direct-charging service center.\\n(iii) Multiply each allocation base by its corresponding cost of money factor to get the facilities capital cost of\\nmoney estimated to be incurred each year. The sum of these products represents the estimated contract facilities capital cost\\nof money for the year\\'s effort.\\n(iv) Total contract facilities cost of money is the sum of the yearly amounts.\\n(v) Since the facilities capital cost of money factors reflect the applicable cost of money rate in Column 1 of Form\\nCASB-CMF, divide the contract cost of money by that same rate to determine the contract facilities capital employed.\\n(d) Preaward facilities capital applications. To establish cost and price objectives, apply the facilities capital cost of\\nmoney and capital employed as follows:\\n(1) Cost of Money.\\n(i) Cost Objective. Use the imputed facilities capital cost of money, with normal, booked costs, to establish a cost\\nobjective or the target cost when structuring an incentive type contract. Do not adjust target costs established at the outset\\neven though actual cost of money rates become available during the period of contract performance.\\n(ii) Profit Objective. When measuring the contractor\\'s effort for the purpose of establishing a prenegotiation profit\\nobjective, restrict the cost base to normal, booked costs. Do not include cost of money as part of the cost base.\\n(2) Facilities Capital Employed. Assess and weight the profit objective for risk associated with facilities capital\\nemployed in accordance with the profit guidelines at 215.404-71 -4.\\n(e) Determination.

Do not make\\nthis addition if the value of intracompany transfers has been included in Block 20 at price (i.e., including G&A expenses and\\nprofit).\\n(3) Multiply (1) by (2).\\n(f) Values: Normal and designated ranges.\\nAsset Type\\nNormal Value\\nDesignated Range\\nLand\\n0%\\nN/A\\nBuildings\\n0%\\nN/A\\n215.4-16\\n\\nSUBPART 215.4 - CONTRACT PRICING\\n215.404-71-5\\nEquipment\\n17.5%\\n10% to 25%\\n(g) Evaluation criteria.\\n(1) In evaluating facilities capital employed, the contracting officer—\\n(i) Should relate the usefulness of the facilities capital to the goods or services being acquired under the prospective\\ncontract;\\n(ii) Should analyze the productivity improvements and other anticipated industrial base enhancing benefits resulting\\nfrom the facilities capital investment, including—\\n(A) The economic value of the facilities capital, such as physical age, undepreciated value, idleness, and expected\\ncontribution to future defense needs; and\\n(B) The contractor\\'s level of investment in defense related facilities as compared with the portion of the\\ncontractor\\'s total business that is derived from DoD; and\\n(iii) Should consider any contractual provisions that reduce the contractor\\'s risk of investment recovery, such as\\ntermination protection clauses and capital investment indemnification.\\n(2) Above normal conditions.\\n(i) The contracting officer may assign a higher than normal value if the facilities capital investment has direct,\\nidentifiable, and exceptional benefits. Indicators are—\\n(A) New investments in state-of-the-art technology that reduce acquisition cost or yield other tangible benefits\\nsuch as improved product quality or accelerated deliveries; or\\n(B) Investments in new equipment for research and development applications.\\n(ii) The contracting officer may assign a value significantly above normal when there are direct and measurable\\nbenefits in efficiency and significantly reduced acquisition costs on the effort being priced. Maximum values apply only to\\nthose cases where the benefits of the facilities capital investment are substantially above normal.\\n(3) Below normal conditions.\\n(i) The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value if the facilities capital investment has little benefit\\nto DoD. Indicators are—\\n(A) Allocations of capital apply predominantly to commercial product lines;\\n(B) Investments are for such things as furniture and fixtures, home or group level administrative offices,\\ncorporate aircraft and hangars, gymnasiums; or\\n(C) Facilities are old or extensively idle.\\n(ii) The contracting officer may assign a value significantly below normal when a significant portion of defense\\nmanufacturing is done in an environment characterized by outdated, inefficient, and labor-intensive capital equipment.\\n215.404-71-5 Cost efficiency factor.\\n(a) This special factor provides an incentive for contractors to reduce costs. To the extent that the contractor can\\ndemonstrate cost reduction efforts that benefit the pending contract, the contracting officer may increase the prenegotiation\\nprofit objective by an amount not to exceed 4 percent of total objective cost (Block 20 of the DD Form 1547) to recognize\\nthese efforts (Block 29).\\n(b) To determine if using this factor is appropriate, the contracting officer shall consider criteria, such as the following, to\\nevaluate the benefit the contractor’s cost reduction efforts will have on the pending contract:\\n(1) The contractor’s participation in Single Process Initiative improvements;\\n(2) Actual cost reductions achieved on prior contracts;\\n(3) Reduction or elimination of excess or idle facilities;\\n(4) The contractor’s cost reduction initiatives (e.g., competition advocacy programs, technical insertion programs,\\nobsolete parts control programs, spare parts pricing reform, value engineering, outsourcing of functions such as information\\ntechnology). Metrics developed by the contractor such as fully loaded labor hours (i.e., cost per labor hour, including\\nall direct and indirect costs) or other productivity measures may provide the basis for assessing the effectiveness of the\\ncontractor’s cost reduction initiatives over time;\\n(5) The contractor’s adoption of process improvements to reduce costs;\\n(6) Subcontractor cost reduction efforts;\\n(7) The contractor’s effective incorporation of commercial products or commercial services and commercial processes;\\nor\\n215.4-17\\n\\n215.404-72\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(8) The contractor’s investment in new facilities when such investments contribute to better asset utilization or\\nimproved productivity.\\n(c) When selecting the percentage to use for this special factor, the contracting officer has maximum flexibility in\\ndetermining the best way to evaluate the benefit the contractor’s cost reduction efforts will have on the pending contract.\\nHowever, the contracting officer shall consider the impact that quantity differences, learning, changes in scope, and economic\\nfactors such as inflation and deflation will have on cost reduction.\\n215.404-72 Modified weighted guidelines method for nonprofit organizations other than FFRDCs.\\n(a) Definition. As used in this subpart, a nonprofit organization is a business entity—\\n(1) That operates exclusively for charitable, scientific, or educational purposes;\\n(2) Whose earnings do not benefit any private shareholder or individual;\\n(3) Whose activities do not involve influencing legislation or political campaigning for any candidate for public office;\\nand\\n(4) That is exempted from Federal income taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code.\\n(b) For nonprofit organizations that are entities that have been identified by the Secretary of Defense or a Secretary of\\na Department as receiving sustaining support on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis from a particular DoD department or agency,\\ncompute a fee objective for covered actions using the weighted guidelines method in 215.404-71 , with the following\\nmodifications:\\n(1) Modifications to performance risk (Blocks 21-23 of the DD Form 1547).\\n(i) If the contracting officer assigns a value from the standard designated range (see 215.404-71 -2(c)), reduce the\\nfee objective by an amount equal to 1 percent of the costs in Block 20 of the DD Form 1547. Show the net (reduced) amount\\non the DD Form 1547.\\n(ii) Do not assign a value from the technology incentive designated range.\\n(2) Modifications to contract type risk (Block 24 of the DD Form 1547). Use a designated range of –1 percent to 0\\npercent instead of the values in 215.404-71 -3. There is no normal value.\\n(c) For all other nonprofit organizations except FFRDCs, compute a fee objective for covered actions using the weighted\\nguidelines method in 215.404-71 , modified as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection.\\n215.404-73 Alternate structured approaches.\\n(a) The contracting officer may use an alternate structured approach under 215.404-4 (c).\\n(b) The contracting officer may design the structure of the alternate, but it shall include—\\n(1) Consideration of the three basic components of profit—performance risk, contract type risk (including working\\ncapital), and facilities capital employed. However, the contracting officer is not required to complete Blocks 21 through 30 of\\nthe DD Form 1547.\\n(2) Offset for facilities capital cost of money.\\n(i) The contracting officer shall reduce the overall prenegotiation profit objective by the amount of facilities capital\\ncost of money under Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) 414, Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Facilities Capital\\n(48 CFR 9904.414). Cost of money under CAS 417, Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under\\nConstruction (48 CFR 9904.417), should not be used to reduce the overall prenegotiation profit objective. The profit amount\\nin the negotiation summary of the DD Form 1547 must be net of the offset.\\n(ii) This adjustment is needed for the following reason: The values of the profit factors used in the weighted\\nguidelines method were adjusted to recognize the shift in facilities capital cost of money from an element of profit to an\\nelement of contract cost (see FAR 31.205-10) and reductions were made directly to the profit factors for performance risk. In\\norder to ensure that this policy is applied to all DoD contracts that allow facilities capital cost of money, similar adjustments\\nshall be made to contracts that use alternate structured approaches.\\n215.404-74 Fee requirements for cost-plus-award-fee contracts.\\nIn developing a fee objective for cost-plus-award-fee contracts, the contracting officer shall—\\n(a) Follow the guidance in FAR 16.405-2 and 216.405-2 ;\\n(b) Not use the weighted guidelines method or alternate structured approach;\\n(c) Apply the offset policy in 215.404-73 (b)(2) for facilities capital cost of money, i.e., reduce the base fee by the amount\\nof facilities capital cost of money; and\\n(d) Not complete a DD Form 1547.\\n215.4-18\\n\\nSUBPART 215.4 - CONTRACT PRICING\\n215.407-3\\n215.404-75 Fee requirements for FFRDCs.\\nFor nonprofit organizations that are FFRDCs, the contracting officer—\\n(a) Should consider whether any fee is appropriate.

Do not award the multiyear contract unless the analysis shows\\nthat the multiyear contract will result in the lower cost (10 U.S.C. 3501(l)(7); section 8008(a) of Pub. L. 105-56, and similar\\nsections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts).\\n(b) The head of the agency must provide written notice to the congressional defense committees at least 30 days before\\ntermination of any multiyear contract (section 8010of Division C, Title VIII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing\\nAppropriations Act, 2015 (Pub.

DoD will include the request, for each candidate it supports, as part of the President’s Budget for\\nthat year and in the Appendix to that budget as part of proposed legislative language for the appropriations bill for that year\\n(section 8008(b) of Pub. L. 105-56).\\n(3) If the advisability of using a multiyear contract becomes apparent too late to satisfy the requirements in paragraph\\n(d)(2) of this section, the request for authority to enter into a multiyear contract must be—\\n(i) Formally submitted by the President as a budget amendment; or\\n(ii) Made by the Secretary of Defense, in writing, to the congressional defense committees (section 8008(b) of Pub.\\nL. 105-56).\\n(4) Agencies must establish reporting procedures to meet the congressional notification requirements of paragraph (d)\\n(1) of this section. The head of the agency must submit a copy of each notice to the Principal Director, Defense Pricing and\\nContracting (DPC), Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment) (OUSD(A&S))DPC), and to the\\nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (Program/Budget) (OUSD(C)(P/B)).\\n217.1-1\\n\\n217.171\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(5) If the budget for a contract that contains a cancellation ceiling in excess of $150 million does not include proposed\\nfunding for the costs of contract cancellation up to the cancellation ceiling established in the contract—\\n(i) The notification required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall include—\\n(A) The cancellation ceiling amounts planned for each program year in the proposed multiyear contract, together\\nwith the reasons for the amounts planned;\\n(B) The extent to which costs of contract cancellation are not included in the budget for the contract; and\\n(C) A financial risk assessment of not including budgeting for costs of contract cancellation (10 U.S.C. 3501(g)\\nand 10 U.S.C. 3531(d)); and\\n(ii) The head of the agency shall provide copies of the notification to the Office of Management and Budget at least\\n14 days before contract award.\\n217.171 Multiyear contracts for services.\\n(a) The head of the agency may enter into a multiyear contract for a period of not more than 5 years for the following\\ntypes of services (and items of supply relating to such services), even though funds are limited by statute to obligation only\\nduring the fiscal year for which they were appropriated (10 U.S.C. 2306c(a)). Covered services are—\\n(1) Operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and installations;\\n(2) Maintenance or modification of aircraft, ships, vehicles, and other highly complex military equipment;\\n(3) Specialized training requiring high quality instructor skills (e.g., training for pilots and aircrew members or foreign\\nlanguage training);\\n(4) Base services (e.g., ground maintenance, in-plane refueling, bus transportation, and refuse collection and disposal);\\nand\\n(5) Environmental remediation services for—\\n(i) An active military installation;\\n(ii) A military installation being closed or realigned under a base closure law as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2667(h)(2); or\\n(iii) A site formerly used by DoD (10 U.S.C. 3531(b)).\\n(b) The head of the agency must be guided by the following principles when entering into a multiyear contract for\\nservices:\\n(1) The portion of the cost of any plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance should not exceed\\nthe ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life of the plant or equipment. As\\nused in this section, \"useful commercial life\" means the commercial utility of the facilities rather than the physical life, with\\ndue consideration given to such factors as the location, specialized nature, and obsolescence of the facilities.\\n(2) Consider the desirability of obtaining an option to extend the term of the contract for a reasonable period not to\\nexceed 3 years at prices that do not include charges for plant, equipment, or other nonrecurring costs already amortized.\\n(3) Consider the desirability of reserving the right to take title, under the appropriate circumstances, to the plant or\\nequipment upon payment of the unamortized portion of the cost (10 U.S.C. 3531(c)).\\n(c) Before entering into a multiyear contract for services, the head of the agency must make a written determination that—\\n(1) There will be a continuing requirement for the services consistent with current plans for the proposed contract\\nperiod;\\n(2) Furnishing the services will require—\\n(i) A substantial initial investment in plant or equipment; or\\n(ii) The incurrence of substantial contingent liabilities for the assembly, training, or transportation of a specialized\\nwork force; and\\n(3) Using a multiyear contract will promote the best interests of the United States by encouraging effective competition\\nand promoting economies in operations (10 U.S.C. 3531(a)).\\n(d) The head of an agency may not initiate a multiyear contract for services if the value of the multiyear contract exceeds\\n$750 million unless a law specifically provides authority for the contract (10 U.S.C. 3531(d)(2)).\\n217.172 Multiyear contracts for supplies.\\n(a) This section applies to all multiyear contracts for supplies, including weapon systems and other multiyear acquisitions\\nspecifically authorized by law (10 U.S.C. 3501).\\n(b) The head of the agency may enter into a multiyear contract for supplies if, in addition to the conditions listed in FAR\\n17.105-1(b), the use of such a contract will promote the national security of the United States (10 U.S.C. 3501(a)(6)).\\n217.1-2\\n\\nSUBPART 217.1 - MULTIYEAR CONTRACTING\\n217.172\\n(c) Multiyear contracts in amounts exceeding $750 million must be specifically authorized by law in an act other than an\\nappropriations act (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(1)).\\n(d) The head of the agency may not initiate a multiyear procurement contract for any system (or component thereof) if\\nthe value of the multiyear contract would exceed $750 million unless authority for the contract is specifically provided in an\\nappropriations act (10 U.S.C. 3501(l)(3)).(e) The head of the agency shall not enter into a multiyear contract unless—\\n(1) The Secretary of Defense has submitted to Congress a budget request for full funding of units to be procured\\nthrough the contract;\\n(2) In the case of a contract for procurement of aircraft, the budget request includes full funding of procurement funds\\nfor production beyond advance procurement activities of aircraft units to be produced in the fiscal year covered by the\\nbudget;\\n(3) Cancellation provisions in the contract do not include consideration of recurring manufacturing costs of the\\ncontractor associated with the production of unfunded units to be delivered under the contract;\\n(4) The contract provides that payments to the contractor under the contract shall not be made in advance of incurred\\ncosts on funded units; and\\n(5) The contract does not provide for a price adjustment based on a failure to award a follow-on contract (section 8010\\nof Division C, Title VIII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235) and similar\\nsections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts).\\n(f)(1) The head of the agency must not enter into or extend a multiyear contract that exceeds $750 million (when entered\\ninto or extended) until the Secretary of Defense identifies the contract and any extension in a report submitted to the\\ncongressional defense committees (10 U.S.C. 3501(l)(5)).\\n(2) In addition, for contracts equal to or greater than $750 million, the head of the contracting activity must determine\\nthat the conditions required by paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section will be met by such contract, in accordance\\nwith the Secretary’s certification and determination required by paragraph (h)(2) of this section.\\n(g) The head of the agency may enter into a multiyear contract for—\\n(1) A weapon system and associated items, services, and logistics support for a weapon system (10 U.S.C.3501(h)(1));\\nand\\n(2) Advance procurement of components, parts, and materials necessary to manufacture a weapon system, including\\nadvance procurement to achieve economic lot purchases or more efficient production rates (see 217.172 (h)(3) and (4) of this\\nsection regarding economic order quantity procurements) (10 U.S.C. 3501(h)(2)). Before initiating an advance procurement,\\nthe contracting officer must verify that it is consistent with DoD policy (e.g., the full funding policy in Volume 2A, chapter 1,\\nof DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation).\\n(h) The head of the agency shall ensure that the following conditions are satisfied before awarding a multiyear contract\\nfor a defense acquisition program that has been specifically authorized by law to be carried out using multiyear contract\\nauthority:\\n(1) The multiyear exhibits required by DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation, are included in the agency’s\\nbudget estimate submission and the President’s budget request.\\n(2) The Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress in writing, by no later than30 days before entry into such contracts,\\nthat each of the conditions in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section is satisfied (10 U.S.C.3501(i)(3).\\n(i) The Secretary has determined that each of the requirements in FAR 17.105-1, paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5),\\nwill be met by such contract and has provided the basis for such determination to the congressional defense committees (10\\nU.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(A)).\\n(ii) The Secretary’s determination under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section was made after the completion of a cost\\nanalysis performed by the Defense Cost and Resource Center of the Department of Defense and such analysis supports the\\nfindings (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(B)).\\n(iii) The system being acquired pursuant to such contract has not been determined to have experienced cost growth\\nin excess of the critical cost growth threshold pursuant to 10 U.S.C 4371(a)(3) within 5 years prior to the date the Secretary\\nanticipates such contract (or a contract for advance procurement entered into consistent with the authorization for such\\ncontract) will be awarded (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(C)).\\n(iv) A sufficient number of end items of the system being acquired under such contract have been delivered at or\\nwithin the most current estimates of the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost for such system to determine\\nthat current estimates of such unit costs are realistic (10 U.S.C.3501(i)(3)(D)).\\n217.1-3\\n\\n217.173\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(v) Sufficient funds will be available in the fiscal year in which the contract is to be awarded to perform the contract,\\nand the future-years defense program for such fiscal year will include the funding required to execute the program without\\ncancellation (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(E)).\\n(vi) The contract is a fixed price type contract (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(F)).\\n(vii) The proposed multiyear contract provides for production at not less than minimum economic rates, given the\\nexisting tooling and facilities (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(G)).

Otherwise, the determination shall be made at the time the service call or order is\\nplaced against the contract. The service call or order shall identify the labor standards law and contract wage determination\\nwhich will apply to the work required.\\n(f) Contracting officers may not avoid application of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute by splitting\\nindividual tasks between orders or contracts.\\n222.403 Statutory, Executive order, and regulatory requirements.\\n222.403-470 Department of Labor regulations.\\nDirect all questions regarding Department of Labor regulations to the labor advisor.\\n222.404 Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute wage determinations.\\nNot later than April 1 of each year, each department and agency shall furnish the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division,\\nwith a general outline of its proposed construction program for the coming fiscal year.

For additional information see 225.7306.\\n(i) An offset agreement is the contractual arrangement between the FMS customer and the U.S. defense contractor\\nthat identifies the offset obligation imposed by the FMS customer that has been accepted by the U.S. defense contractor as a\\ncondition of the FMS customer\\'s purchase. These agreements are distinct and independent of the LOA and the FMS contract.\\nFurther information about offsets and LOAs may be found in the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Security\\nAssistance Management Manual (DSCA 5105.38-M), chapter 6, paragraph 6.3.9.

FMS customers are placed on notice through the LOA that indirect offset costs are deemed\\nreasonable without any further analysis by the contracting officer.\\n(4) Costs that are the subject of advance agreement under the appropriate provisions of FAR part 31; or where the\\nadvance understanding places a limit on the amounts of cost that will be recognized as allowable in defense contract pricing,\\nand the agreement contemplated that it will apply only to DoD contracts for the U.S. Government\\'s own requirement (as\\ndistinguished from contracts for FMS).\\n(b) Costs not allowable under FAR part 31 are not allowable in pricing FMS contracts, except as noted in paragraphs (c)\\nand (e) of this subsection.\\n(c) The limitations for all contractors described in 231.205-18(c)(iii) and (iv) do not apply to FMS contracts, except as\\nprovided in 225.7303-5.

In pricing contracts for\\nsuch FMS -\\n(1) Use the best estimate of reasonable costs in forward pricing; and\\n(2) Use actual expenditures, to the extent that they are reasonable, in determining final cost.\\n(d) Under paragraph (e)(1)(A) of Section 21 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2761), the United States must\\ncharge for administrative services to recover the estimated cost of administration of sales made under the Army Export\\nControl Act.\\n225.73-2\\n\\nSUBPART 225.73 - ACQUISITIONS FOR FOREIGN MILITARY SALES\\n225.7304\\n(e) The limitations in 231.205-1 on allowability of costs associated with leasing Government equipment do not apply to\\nFMS contracts.\\n225.7303-3 Government-to-government agreements.\\nIf a government-to-government agreement between the United States and a foreign government for the sale, coproduction,\\nor cooperative logistic support of a specifically defined weapon system, major end item, or support item, contains language in\\nconflict with the provisions of this section, the language of the government-to-government agreement prevails.\\n225.7303-4 Contingent fees.\\n(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, contingent fees are generally allowable under DoD contracts,\\nprovided—\\n(1) The fees are paid to a bona fide employee or a bona fide established commercial or selling agency maintained by\\nthe prospective contractor for the purpose of securing business (see FAR Part 31 and FAR Subpart 3.4); and\\n(2) The contracting officer determines that the fees are fair and reasonable.\\n(b)(1) Under DoD 5105.38-M, LOAs for requirements for the governments of Australia, Taiwan, Egypt, Greece, Israel,\\nJapan, Jordan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Thailand, or Venezuela (Air Force)\\nshall provide that all U.S. Government contracts resulting from the LOAs prohibit the reimbursement of contingent fees as\\nan allowable cost under the contract, unless the contractor identifies the payments and the foreign customer approves the\\npayments in writing before contract award (see 225.7307 (a)).\\n(2) For FMS to countries not listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection, contingent fees exceeding $50,000 per FMS\\ncase are unallowable under DoD contracts, unless the contractor identifies the payment and the foreign customer approves the\\npayment in writing before contract award.\\n225.7303-5 Acquisitions wholly paid for from nonrepayable funds.\\n(a) In accordance with 22 U.S.C. 2762(d), price FMS wholly paid for from funds made available on a nonrepayable\\nbasis on the same costing basis with regard to profit, overhead, IR&D/B&P, and other costing elements as is applicable to\\nacquisitions of like items purchased by DoD for its own use.\\n(b) Direct costs associated with meeting a foreign customer’s additional or unique requirements are allowable under such\\ncontracts. Indirect burden rates applicable to such direct costs are permitted at the same rates applicable to acquisitions of like\\nitems purchased by DoD for its own use.\\n(c) A U.S. defense contractor may not recover costs incurred for offset agreements with a foreign government or\\ninternational organization if the LOA is financed with funds made available on a nonrepayable basis.\\n225.7304 FMS customer involvement.\\n(a) FMS customers may request that a defense article or defense service be obtained from a particular contractor. In such\\ncases, FAR 6.302-4 provides authority to contract without full and open competition. The FMS customer may also request\\nthat a subcontract be placed with a particular firm. The contracting officer shall honor such requests from the FMS customer\\nonly if the LOA or other written direction sufficiently fulfills the requirements of FAR Subpart 6.3.\\n(b) FMS customers should be encouraged to participate with U.S. Government acquisition personnel in discussions with\\nindustry to—\\n(1) Develop technical specifications;\\n(2) Establish delivery schedules;\\n(3) Identify any special warranty provisions or other requirements unique to the FMS customer; and\\n(4) Review prices of varying alternatives, quantities, and options needed to make price-performance tradeoffs.\\n(c) Do not disclose to the FMS customer any data, including certified cost or pricing data, that is contractor proprietary\\nunless the contractor authorizes its release.\\n(d) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the degree of FMS customer participation in contract\\nnegotiations is left to the discretion of the contracting officer after consultation with the contractor. The contracting officer\\nshall provide an explanation to the FMS customer if its participation in negotiations will be limited. Factors that may limit\\nFMS customer participation include situations where—\\n(1) The contract includes requirements for more than one FMS customer;\\n(2) The contract includes unique U.S. requirements; or\\n(3) Contractor proprietary data is a subject of negotiations.\\n225.73-3\\n\\n225.7305\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(e) Do not allow representatives of the FMS customer to—\\n(1) Direct the exclusion of certain firms from the solicitation process (they may suggest the inclusion of certain firms);\\n(2) Interfere with a contractor\\'s placement of subcontracts; or\\n(3) Observe or participate in negotiations between the U.S. Government and the contractor involving certified cost or\\npricing data, unless a deviation is granted in accordance with subpart 201.4.\\n(f) Do not accept directions from the FMS customer on source selection decisions or contract terms (except that, upon\\ntimely notice, the contracting officer may attempt to obtain any special contract provisions, warranties, or other unique\\nrequirements requested by the FMS customer).\\n(g) Do not honor any requests by the FMS customer to reject any bid or proposal.\\n(h) If an FMS customer requests additional data concerning FMS contract prices, the contracting officer shall, after\\nconsultation with the contractor, provide sufficient data to demonstrate the reasonableness of the price and reasonable\\nresponses to relevant questions concerning contract price. This data—\\n(1) May include tailored responses, top-level pricing summaries, historical prices, or an explanation of any significant\\ndifferences between the actual contract price and the estimated contract price included in the initial LOA; and\\n(2) May be provided orally, in writing, or by any other method acceptable to the contracting officer.\\n225.7305 Limitation of liability.\\nAdvise the contractor when the foreign customer will assume the risk for loss or damage under the appropriate limitation\\nof liability clause(s) (see FAR Subpart 46.8). Consider the costs of necessary insurance, if any, obtained by the contractor to\\ncover the risk of loss or damage in establishing the FMS contract price.\\n225.7306 Offset arrangements.\\nIn accordance with the Presidential policy statement of April 16, 1990, DoD does not encourage, enter into, or commit\\nU.S. firms to FMS offset arrangements.

The development of such sources may\\nbe accomplished by an agreement, often called a foreign licensing agreement or technical assistance agreement, wherein a\\ndomestic concern, referred to in this subpart as a “primary source,” agrees to furnish to a foreign concern or government,\\nherein referred to as a “second source;” foreign patent rights; technical assistance in the form of data, know-how, trained\\npersonnel of the primary source, instruction and guidance of the personnel of the second source, jigs, dies, fixtures, or other\\nmanufacturing aids, or such other assistance, information, rights, or licenses as are needed to enable the second source to\\nproduce particular supplies or perform particular services. Agreements calling for one or more of the foregoing may be\\nentered into between the primary source and the Government, a foreign government, or a foreign concern. The consideration\\nfor providing such foreign license and technical assistance may be in the form of a lump sum payment, payments for each\\nitem manufactured by the second source, an agreement to exchange data and patent rights on improvements made to the\\narticle or service, capital stock transactions, or any combination of these. The primary source\\'s bases for computing such\\nconsideration may include actual costs; charges for the use of patents, data, or know-how reflecting the primary source\\'s\\ninvestment in developing and engineering and production techniques; and the primary source\\'s “price” for setting up a second\\nsource. Such agreements often refer to the compensation to be paid as a royalty or license fee whether or not patent rights are\\ninvolved.\\n227.672 Policy.\\nIt is Government policy not to pay in connection with its contracts, and not to allow to be paid in connection with contracts\\nmade with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the United States Government,\\ncharges for use of patents in which it holds a royalty-free license or charges for data which it has a right to use and disclose\\nto others, or which is in the public domain, or which the Government has acquired without restriction upon its use and\\ndisclosure to others. This policy shall be applied by the Departments in negotiating contract prices for foreign license\\ntechnical assistance contracts (227.675) or supply contracts with second sources (227.674); and in commenting on such\\nagreements when they are referred to the Department of Defense by the Department of State pursuant to Section 414 of the\\nMutual Security Act of 1954 as amended (22 U.S.C. 1934) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (see 227.675 ).\\n227.673 Foreign license and technical assistance agreements between the Government and domestic concerns.\\n(a) Contracts between the Government and a primary source to provide technical assistance or patent rights to a second\\nsource for the manufacture of supplies or performance of services shall, to the extent practicable, specify the rights in patents\\nand data and any other rights to be supplied to the second source. Each contract shall provide, in connection with any separate\\nagreement between the primary source and the second source for patent rights or technical assistance relating to the articles or\\nservices involved in the contract, that—\\n(1) The primary source and his subcontractors shall not make, on account of any purchases by the Government or by\\nothers with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government, any charge to the\\nsecond source for royalties or amortization for patents or inventions in which the Government holds a royalty-free license; or\\ndata which the Government has the right to possess, use, and disclose to others; or any technical assistance provided to the\\nsecond source for which the Government has paid under a contract between the Government and the primary source; and\\n(2) The separate agreement between the primary and second source shall include a statement referring to the contract\\nbetween the Government and the primary source, and shall conform to the requirements of the International Traffic in Arms\\nRegulations (see 227.675-1 ).\\n(b) The following factors, among others, shall be considered in negotiating the price to be paid the primary source under\\ncontracts within (a) of this section:\\n(1) The actual cost of providing data, personnel, manufacturing aids, samples, spare parts, and the like;\\n(2) The extent to which the Government has contributed to the development of the supplies or services, and to the\\nmethods of manufacture or performance, through past contracts for research and development or for manufacture of the\\nsupplies or performance of the services; and\\n227.6-1\\n\\n227.674\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(3) The Government\\'s patent rights and rights in data relating to the supplies or services and to the methods of\\nmanufacture or of performance.\\n227.674 Supply contracts between the Government and a foreign government or concern.\\nIn negotiating contract prices with a second source, including the redetermination of contract prices, or in determining the\\nallowability of costs under a cost-reimbursement contract with a second source, the contracting officer:\\n(a) Shall obtain from the second source a detailed statement (see FAR 27.204-1(a)(2)) of royalties, license fees, and\\nother compensation paid or to be paid to a primary source (or any of his subcontractors) for patent rights, rights in data, and\\nother technical assistance provided to the second source, including identification and description of such patents, data, and\\ntechnical assistance; and\\n(b) Shall not accept or allow charges which in effect are—\\n(1) For royalties or amortization for patents or inventions in which the Government holds a royalty-free license; or\\n(2) For data which the Government has a right to possess, use, and disclose to others; or\\n(3) For any technical assistance provided to the second source for which the Government has paid under a contract\\nbetween the Government and a primary source.\\n227.675 Foreign license and technical assistance agreements between a domestic concern and a foreign government or\\nconcern.\\n227.675-1 International Traffic in Arms Regulations.\\nPursuant to Section 414 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended (22 U.S.C. 1934), the Department of State\\ncontrols the exportation of data relating to articles designated in the United States Munitions List as arms, ammunition, or\\nmunitions of war. (The Munitions List and pertinent procedures are set forth in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations,\\n22 CFR, et seq.)

Reprocurement needs may not be a sufficient reason to acquire detailed manufacturing or process data\\nwhen items or components can be acquired using performance specifications, form, fit, and function data, or when there are a\\nsufficient number of alternate sources that can reasonably be expected to provide such items on a performance specification\\nor form, fit, or function basis.\\n(2) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or other request for data, data managers must balance\\nthe original assessment of the Government\\'s data needs with data prices contained in the offer.\\n(c) Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that, wherever practicable, solicitations and contracts—\\n(1) Identify the type and quantity of the technical data to be delivered under the contract and the format and media in\\nwhich the data will be delivered;\\n(2) Establish each deliverable data item as a separate contract line item (this requirement may be satisfied by listing\\neach deliverable data item on an exhibit to the contract);\\n(3) Identify the prices established for each deliverable data item under a fixed-price type contract;\\n(4) Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each deliverable data item; and\\n(5) Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable item of technical data.\\n227.7103-3 Early identification of technical data to be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use,\\nreproduction, or disclosure.\\n(a) 10 U.S.C. 3772(a) requires, to the maximum extent practicable, an identification prior to delivery of any technical data\\nto be delivered to the Government with restrictions on use.\\n(b) Use the provision at 252.227-7017 , Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, in\\nall solicitations that include the clause at 252.227-7013 , Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products\\nand Commercial Services. The provision requires offerors to identify any technical data for which restrictions, other than\\ncopyright, on use, release, or disclosure are asserted and to attach the identification and assertions to the offer.\\n(c) Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7013 permits a contractor, under certain conditions, to make\\nadditional assertions of use, release, or disclosure restrictions. The prescription for the use of that clause and its alternate is at\\n227.7103-6 (a) and (b).\\n227.7103-4 License rights.\\n(a) Grant of license. The Government obtains rights in technical data, including a copyright license, under an irrevocable\\nlicense granted or obtained for the Government by the contractor. The contractor or licensor retains all rights in the data not\\ngranted to the Government. For technical data that pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is\\ngenerally determined by the source of funds used to develop the item, component, or process. When the technical data do not\\npertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is determined by the source of funds used to create the\\ndata.\\n(1) Technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes. Contractors or licensors may, with some exceptions\\n(see 227.7103-5 (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9)), restrict the Government\\'s rights to use, modify, release, reproduce, perform,\\ndisplay or disclose technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense\\n(limited rights). They may not restrict the Government\\'s rights in items, components, or processes developed exclusively\\nat Government expense (unlimited rights) without the Government\\'s approval. When an item, component, or process is\\n227.71-3\\n\\n227.7103-5\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\ndeveloped with mixed funding, the Government may use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display or disclose the data\\npertaining to such items, components, or processes within the Government without restriction but may release or disclose the\\ndata outside the Government only for government purposes (government purpose rights).\\n(2) Technical data that do not pertain to items, components, or processes. Technical data may be created during the\\nperformance of a contract for a conceptual design or similar effort that does not require the development, manufacture,\\nconstruction, or production of items, components or processes. The Government generally obtains unlimited rights in such\\ndata when the data were created exclusively with Government funds, government purpose rights when the data were created\\nwith mixed funding, and limited rights when the data were created exclusively at private expense.\\n(b) Source of funds determination. The determination of the source of development funds for technical data pertaining\\nto items, components, or processes should be made at any practical sub-item or sub-component level or for any segregable\\nportion of a process. Contractors may assert limited rights in a segregable sub-item, sub-component, or portion of a process\\nwhich otherwise qualifies for limited rights under the clause at 252.227-7013 , Rights in Technical Data–Noncommercial\\nItems.\\n227.7103-5 Government rights.\\nThe standard license rights that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or\\nlimited rights. Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227-7013 , Rights in Technical Data–Other Than Commercial\\nProducts and Commercial Services. In unusual situations, the standard rights may not satisfy the Government\\'s needs or the\\nGovernment may be willing to accept lesser rights in data in return for other consideration. In those cases, a special license\\nmay be negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater rights and the contracting officer\\nis not required to accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license. The situations under which a\\nparticular grant of license applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.\\n(a) Unlimited rights. The Government obtains unlimited rights in technical data that are—\\n(1) Data pertaining to an item, component, or process which has been or will be developed exclusively with\\nGovernment funds;\\n(2) Studies, analyses, test data, or similar data produced in the performance of a contract when the study, analysis, test,\\nor similar work was specified as an element of performance;\\n(3) Created exclusively with Government funds in the performance of a contract that does not require the development,\\nmanufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes;\\n(4) Form, fit, and function data;\\n(5) Necessary for installation, operation, maintenance, or training purposes (other than detailed manufacturing or\\nprocess data);\\n(6) Corrections or changes to technical data furnished to the contractor by the Government;\\n(7) Publicly available or have been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on\\nfurther use, release or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of\\ninterest in the software to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party;\\n(8) Data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result of\\nnegotiations; or\\n(9) Data furnished to the Government, under a Government contract or subcontract thereunder, with—\\n(i) Government purpose license rights or limited rights and the restrictive condition(s) has/have expired; or\\n(ii) Government purpose rights and the contractor\\'s exclusive right to use such data for commercial purposes has\\nexpired.\\n(b) Government purpose rights.\\n(1) The Government obtains government purpose rights in technical data—\\n(i) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed with mixed funding except when the Government is\\nentitled to unlimited rights as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) of this subsection; or\\n(ii) Created with mixed funding in the performance of a contract that does not require the development,\\nmanufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.\\n(2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective is negotiable. The clause at 252.227-7013\\nprovides a nominal five-year period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the government purpose rights\\nperiod may be made at any time prior to delivery of the technical data without consideration from either party. Longer periods\\nshould be negotiated when a five-year period does not provide sufficient time to apply the data for commercial purposes or\\nwhen necessary to recognize subcontractors\\' interests in the data.\\n227.71-4\\n\\nSUBPART 227.71 - TECHNICAL DATA AND ASSOCIATED RIGHTS\\n227.7103-5\\n(3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or\\nsimilar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required the development. Upon expiration of\\nthe Government rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the data including the right to authorize others to use\\nthe data for commercial purposes.\\n(4) During the government purpose rights period, the Government may not use, or authorize other persons to use,\\ntechnical data marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The Government shall not release or\\ndisclose data in which it has government purpose rights to any person, or authorize others to do so, unless—\\n(i) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at\\n227.7103-7 ; or\\n(ii) The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving access to the data for performance of a Government\\ncontract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025 , Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished\\nInformation Marked with Restrictive Legends.\\n(5) When technical data marked with government purpose rights legends will be released or disclosed to a Government\\ncontractor performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252.227-7025 , the contract may be modified, prior to\\nrelease or disclosure, to include that clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and non-disclosure agreement.\\n(6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that technical data marked with government purpose\\nrights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a Government solicitation, only to\\npersons subject to the use and non-disclosure restrictions. Public announcements in the Commerce Business Daily or other\\npublications must provide notice of the use and non-disclosure requirements. Class use and non-disclosure agreements (e.g.,\\nagreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a reasonable period) are authorized and may be\\nobtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights data. Documents transmitting government\\npurpose rights data to persons under class agreements shall identify the technical data subject to government purpose rights\\nand the class agreement under which such data are provided.\\n(c) Limited rights.\\n(1) The Government obtains limited rights in technical data—\\n(i) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense except when the\\nGovernment is entitled to unlimited rights as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) of this subsection; or\\n(ii) Created exclusively at private expense in the performance of a contract that does not require the development,\\nmanufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.\\n(2) Data in which the Government has limited rights may not be used, released, or disclosed outside the Government\\nwithout the permission of the contractor asserting the restriction except for a use, release, or disclosure that is—\\n(i) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul;\\n(ii) To a covered Government support contractor; or\\n(iii) To a foreign government, other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use, release, or disclosure is\\nin the interest of the United States and is required for evaluational or informational purposes.\\n(3) The person asserting limited rights must be notified of the Government\\'s intent to release, disclose, or authorize\\nothers to use such data prior to release or disclosure of the data except notification of an intended release, disclosure, or use\\nfor emergency repair or overhaul which shall be made as soon as practicable.\\n(4) When the person asserting limited rights permits the Government to release, disclose, or have others use the data\\nsubject to restrictions on further use, release, or disclosure, or for a release under paragraph (c)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this\\nsubsection, the intended recipient must complete the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 , or receive the data\\nfor performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025 , Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of\\nGovernment-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends, prior to release or disclosure of the limited rights data.\\n(d) Specifically negotiated license rights.\\n(1) Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the Government\\nor when the Government wants to obtain rights in data in which it does not have rights. When negotiating to obtain,\\nrelinquish, or increase the Government\\'s rights in technical data, consider the acquisition strategy for the item, component,\\nor process, including logistics support and other factors which may have relevance for a particular procurement. The\\nGovernment may accept lesser rights when it has unlimited or government purpose rights in data but may not accept less than\\nlimited rights in such data. The negotiated license rights must stipulate what rights the Government has to release or disclose\\nthe data to other persons or to authorize others to use the data. Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part\\nof the contract.\\n227.71-5\\n\\n227.7103-6\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(2) When the Government needs additional rights in data acquired with government purpose or limited rights, the\\ncontracting officer must negotiate with the contractor to determine whether there are acceptable terms for transferring\\nsuch rights. Generally, such negotiations should be conducted only when there is a need to disclose the data outside the\\nGovernment or if the additional rights are required for competitive reprocurement and the anticipated savings expected to\\nbe obtained through competition are estimated to exceed the acquisition cost of the additional rights. Prior to negotiating for\\nadditional rights in limited rights data, consider alternatives such as—\\n(i) Using performance specifications and form, fit, and function data to acquire or develop functionally equivalent\\nitems, components, or processes;\\n(ii) Obtaining a contractor\\'s contractual commitment to qualify additional sources and maintain adequate\\ncompetition among the sources; or\\n(iii) Reverse engineering, or providing items from Government inventories to contractors who request the items to\\nfacilitate the development of equivalent items through reverse engineering.\\n227.7103-6 Contract clauses.\\n(a) Use the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data-Noncommercial Other Than Commercial Products and\\nCommercial Services, in solicitations and contracts, including solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for\\nthe acquisition of commercial products and commercial services, when the successful offeror(s) will be required to deliver\\nto the Government technical data pertaining to other than commercial products or commercial services, or pertaining to\\ncommercial products or commercial services for which the Government will have paid for any portion of the development\\ncosts (in which case the clause at 252.227-7013 will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial\\nproduct or commercial service that was developed in any part at Government expense, and the clause at 252.227-7015\\nwill govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial product or commercial service that was developed\\nexclusively at private expense). Do not use the clause when the only deliverable items are computer software or computer\\nsoftware documentation (see 227.72), commercial products or commercial services developed exclusively at private expense\\n(see 227.7102-4), existing works (see 227.7105 ), special works (see 227.7106 ), or when contracting under the Small\\nBusiness Innovation Research Program (see 227.7104 ). Except as provided in 227.7107-2 , do not use the clause in architect-\\nengineer and construction contracts.\\n(b)(1) Use the clause at 252.227-7013 with its Alternate I in research solicitations and contracts, including research\\nsolicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services,\\nwhen the contracting officer determines, in consultation with counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be—\\n(i) In the interest of the Government; and\\n(ii) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish the work for sale, or to have others publish the\\nwork for sale on behalf of the Government.\\n(2) Use the clause at 252.227-7013 with its Alternate II in solicitations and contracts, including solicitations and\\ncontracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services, that are for the\\ndevelopment or delivery of a vessel design or any useful article embodying a vessel design.\\n(c) Use the clause at 252.227-7025 , Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked\\nwith Restrictive Legends, in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the Government will provide the contractor\\n(other than a litigation support contractor covered by 252.204-7014 ), for performance of its contract, technical data marked\\nwith another contractor\\'s restrictive legend(s).\\n(d) Use the provision at 252.227-7028 , Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government, in\\nsolicitations when the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver technical data. The provision requires offerors to\\nidentify any technical data specified in the solicitation as deliverable data items that are the same or substantially the same as\\ndata items the offeror has delivered or is obligated to deliver, either as a contractor or subcontractor, under any other federal\\nagency contract.\\n(e) Use the following clauses in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7013 :\\n(1) 252.227-7016 , Rights in Bid or Proposal Information;\\n(2) 252.227-7030 , Technical Data–Withholding of Payment; and\\n(3) 252.227-7037 , Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data (paragraph (e) of the clause contains\\ninformation that must be included in a challenge).\\n227.71-6\\n\\nSUBPART 227.71 - TECHNICAL DATA AND ASSOCIATED RIGHTS\\n227.7103-7\\n227.7103-7 Use and non-disclosure agreement.\\n(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, technical data or computer software delivered to the\\nGovernment with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure may not be\\nprovided to third parties unless the intended recipient completes and signs the use and non-disclosure agreement at paragraph\\n(c) of this subsection prior to release, or disclosure of the data.\\n(1) The specific conditions under which an intended recipient will be authorized to use, modify, reproduce, release,\\nperform, display, or disclose technical data subject to limited rights or computer software subject to restricted rights must be\\nstipulated in an attachment to the use and non-disclosure agreement.\\n(2) For an intended release, disclosure, or authorized use of technical data or computer software subject to special\\nlicense rights, modify paragraph (1)(d) of the use and non-disclosure agreement to enter the conditions, consistent with the\\nlicense requirements, governing the recipient\\'s obligations regarding use, modification, reproduction, release, performance,\\ndisplay or disclosure of the data or software.\\n(b) The requirement for use and non-disclosure agreements does not apply to Government contractors which require\\naccess to a third party\\'s data or software for the performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at\\n252.227-7025 , Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive\\nLegends.\\n(c) The prescribed use and non-disclosure agreement is:\\nUse and Non-Disclosure Agreement\\nThe undersigned, __________(Insert Name)__________, an authorized representative of the __________(Insert Company\\nName)__________, (which is hereinafter referred to as the “Recipient”) requests the Government to provide the Recipient\\nwith technical data or computer software (hereinafter referred to as “Data”) in which the Government\\'s use, modification,\\nreproduction, release, performance, display or disclosure rights are restricted.

Use the clause at 252.227-7026 , Deferred Delivery of Technical Data or Computer Software,\\nwhen it is in the Government\\'s interests to defer the delivery of technical data. The clause permits the contracting officer\\nto require the delivery of technical data identified as “deferred delivery” data at any time until two years after acceptance\\nby the Government of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination,\\nwhichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers to deliver such technical data expires two years after the date\\nthe prime contractor accepts the last item from the subcontractor or supplier for use in the performance of the contract. The\\ncontract must specify which technical data is subject to deferred delivery. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor\\nsufficiently in advance of the desired delivery date for such data to permit timely delivery.\\n(b) Deferred ordering. Use the clause at 252.227-7027 , Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software,\\nwhen a firm requirement for a particular data item(s) has not been established prior to contract award but there is a potential\\nneed for the data. Under this clause, the contracting officer may order any data that has been generated in the performance\\nof the contract or any subcontract thereunder at any time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical\\ndata or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors\\nto deliver such data expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last item under the subcontract. When the\\ndata are ordered, the delivery dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated only for converting the data into the\\nprescribed form, reproduction costs, and delivery costs.\\n227.7103-9 Copyright.\\n(a) Copyright license.\\n(1) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data - Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial\\nServices, requires a contractor to grant or obtain for the Government license rights which permit the Government to\\nreproduce data, distribute copies of the data, publicly perform or display the data or, through the right to modify data, prepare\\nderivative works. The extent to which the Government, and others acting on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for\\neach of the standard data rights licenses obtained under the clause. When non-standard license rights in technical data will\\nbe negotiated, negotiate the extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not\\nnegotiate a copyright license that provides less rights than the standard limited rights license in technical data.\\n(2) The clause at 252.227-7013 does not permit a contractor to incorporate a third party\\'s copyrighted data into a\\ndeliverable data item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and, when applicable,\\nothers acting on the Government\\'s behalf, or has obtained the contracting officer\\'s written approval to do so. Grant approval\\nto use third party copyrighted data in which the Government will not receive a copyright license only when the Government\\'s\\nrequirements cannot be satisfied without the third party material or when the use of the third party material will result in cost\\nsavings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright license.\\n(b) Copyright considerations - acquisition of existing and special works. See 227.7105 or 227.7106 for copyright\\nconsiderations when acquiring existing or special works.\\n227.7103-10 Contractor identification and marking of technical data to be furnished with restrictive markings.\\n(a) Identification requirements.\\n(1) The solicitation provision at 252.227-7017 , Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure\\nRestrictions, requires offerors to identify to the contracting officer, prior to contract award, any technical data that the offeror\\n227.71-9\\n\\n227.7103-10\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\nasserts should be provided to the Government with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release or disclosure. This\\nrequirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright. The notification and identification must be submitted\\nas an attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the attachment or fails to complete the attachment in accordance\\nwith the requirements of the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute a minor informality. Provide offerors an\\nopportunity to remedy a minor informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.306. An offeror\\'s failure to\\ncorrect the informality within the time prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible for award.\\n(2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be used to obtain information regarding asserted\\nrestrictions or an offeror\\'s suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the justification for an asserted restriction\\nor asserted rights category must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.7103-13 .\\n(3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be attached to its contract unless, in accordance with the\\nprocedures at 227.7103-13 , the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not justified. The contract attachment shall\\nprovide the same information regarding identification of the technical data, the asserted rights category, the basis for the\\nassertion, and the name of the person asserting the restrictions as required by paragraph (d) of the solicitation provision at\\n252.227-7017 . Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7013 , Rights in Technical Data–Other Than Commercial\\nProducts and Commercial Services, permits the contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The\\nadditional assertions must be made in accordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.\\n(4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor, nor the fact that certain assertions are identified in\\nthe attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As provided at 227.7103-13 , the Government\\nhas the right to review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.\\n(5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation provision may be used in the source selection\\nprocess to evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the Government\\'s ability to use\\nor disclose technical data. However, offerors shall not be prohibited from offering products for which the offeror is entitled\\nto provide the Government limited rights in the technical data pertaining to such products and offerors shall not be required,\\neither as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish any\\ngreater rights in technical data when the offeror is entitled to provide the technical data with limited rights.\\n(b) Contractor marking requirements. The clause at 252.227-7013 , Rights in Technical Data–Other Than Commercial\\nProducts and Commercial Services—\\n(1) Requires a contractor that desires to restrict the Government\\'s rights in technical data to place restrictive markings\\non the data, provides instructions for the placement of the restrictive markings, and authorizes the use of certain restrictive\\nmarkings; and\\n(2) Requires a contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide to the Government any technical data in which the\\nGovernment has previously obtained rights with the Government\\'s pre-existing rights in that data unless the parties have\\nagreed otherwise or restrictions on the Government\\'s rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose\\nthe data have expired. When restrictions are still applicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the data with the appropriate\\nrestrictive legend for which the data qualified.\\n(c) Unmarked technical data.\\n(1) Technical data delivered or otherwise provided under a contract without restrictive markings shall be presumed to\\nhave been delivered with unlimited rights and may be released or disclosed without restriction. To the extent practicable, if a\\ncontractor has requested permission (see paragraph (c)(2) of this subsection) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings,\\ndo not release or disclose the technical data pending evaluation of the request.\\n(2) A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends placed on unmarked technical data at its expense.\\nThe request must be received by the contracting officer within six months following the furnishing or delivery of such data,\\nor any extension of that time approved by the contracting officer. The person making the request must:\\n(i) Identify the technical data that should have been marked;\\n(ii) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the proposed marking is justified and conforms\\nwith the requirements for the marking of technical data contained in the clause at 252.227-7013 ; and\\n(iii) Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability with respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or\\nuse of the technical data made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the omission of the marking.\\n(3) Contracting officers should grant permission to mark only if the technical data were not distributed outside the\\nGovernment or were distributed outside the Government with restrictions on further use or disclosure.\\n227.71-10\\n\\nSUBPART 227.71 - TECHNICAL DATA AND ASSOCIATED RIGHTS\\n227.7103-13\\n227.7103-11 Contractor procedures and records.\\n(a) The clause at 252.227-7013 , Rights in Technical Data–Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services,\\nrequires a contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data with other than unlimited rights, to\\nestablish and follow written procedures to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain\\nrecords to justify the validity of asserted restrictions on delivered data.\\n(b) The clause at 252.227-7037 , Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data requires contractors and their\\nsubcontractors at any tier to maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of restrictive markings on technical data\\ndelivered or to be delivered under a Government contract.\\n227.7103-12 Government right to establish conformity of markings.\\n(a) Nonconforming markings.\\n(1) Authorized markings are identified in the clause at 252.227-7013 , Rights in Technical Data–Other Than\\nCommercial Products and Commercial Services. All other markings are nonconforming markings. An authorized marking\\nthat is not in the form, or differs in substance, from the marking requirements in the clause at 252.227-7013 is also a\\nnonconforming marking.\\n(2) The correction of nonconforming markings on technical data is not subject to 252.227-7037 , Validation of\\nRestrictive Markings on Technical Data. To the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return technical data\\nbearing nonconforming markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on such data to provide that\\nperson an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming marking at that person\\'s expense. If that person fails to correct\\nthe nonconformity and return the corrected data within 60 days following the person\\'s receipt of the data, the contracting\\nofficer may correct or strike the nonconformity at that person\\'s expense. When it is impracticable to return technical data\\nfor correction, contracting officers may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government expense. Prior to\\ncorrection, the data may be used in accordance with the proper restrictive marking.\\n(b) Unjustified markings.\\n(1) An unjustified marking is an authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions applicable to the\\nGovernment\\'s use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the marked technical data. For\\nexample, a limited rights legend placed on technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes that were developed\\nunder a Government contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations under which the\\nGovernment obtains unlimited or government purpose rights) is an unjustified marking.\\n(2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the validity of unjustified markings. However, at any\\ntime during performance of a contract and notwithstanding existence of a challenge, the contracting officer and the person\\nwho has asserted a restrictive marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon such agreement, the\\ncontracting officer may, at his or her election, either—\\n(i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person\\'s expense; or\\n(ii) Return the technical data to the person asserting the restriction for correction at that person\\'s expense. If the data\\nare returned and that person fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected data to the contracting\\nofficer within 60 days following receipt of the data, the unjustified marking shall be corrected or stricken at that person\\'s\\nexpense.\\n227.7103-13 Government right to review, verify, challenge, and validate asserted restrictions.\\n(a) General. An offeror\\'s assertion(s) of restrictions on the Government\\'s rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or\\ndisclose technical data do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the Government\\'s rights in the technical data. Under 10\\nU.S.C. 3782 Government has the right to challenge asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds to question the\\nvalidity of the assertion and continued adherence to the assertion would make it impractical to later procure competitively the\\nitem to which the data pertain.\\n(b) Pre-award considerations. The challenge procedures required by 10 U.S.C. 3782 could significantly delay awards\\nunder competitive procurements. Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award\\nunless resolution of the assertion is essential for successful completion of the procurement.\\n(c) Challenge considerations and presumption.\\n(1) Requirements to initiate a challenge. Contracting officers shall have reasonable grounds to challenge the validity\\nof an asserted restriction. Before issuing a challenge to an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information\\npertaining to the assertion.\\n227.71-11\\n\\n227.7103-13\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(2) Commercial products and commercial services–presumption regarding development exclusively at private expense.\\n10 U.S.C. 3772(a)(1) and 3784 establish a presumption and procedures regarding validation of asserted restrictions for\\ntechnical data related to commercial products or commercial services on the basis of development exclusively at private\\nexpense. Contracting officers shall presume that a commercial product or commercial service was developed exclusively\\nat private expense whether or not a contractor or subcontractor submits a justification in response to a challenge notice.\\nThe contracting officer shall not challenge a contractor\\'s assertion that a commercial product or commercial service was\\ndeveloped exclusively at private expense unless the Government can specifically state the reasonable grounds to question\\nthe validity of the assertion. The challenge notice shall include sufficient information to reasonably demonstrate that the\\ncommercial item was not developed exclusively at private expense. In order to sustain the challenge, the contracting officer\\nshall provide information demonstrating that the commercial product or commercial service was not developed exclusively\\nat private expense. The challenge notice and all related correspondence shall be subject to handling procedures for classified\\ninformation and controlled unclassified information. A contractor\\'s or subcontractor\\'s failure to respond to the challenge\\nnotice cannot be the sole basis for issuing a final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction.\\n(d) Challenge and validation. All challenges must be made in accordance with the provisions of the clause at\\n252.227-7037 , Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data.\\n(1) Challenge period. Asserted restrictions should be reviewed before acceptance of technical data deliverable under\\nthe contract. Assertions must be challenged within three years after final payment under the contract or three years after\\ndelivery of the data, whichever is later. However, restrictive markings may be challenged at any time if the technical data—\\n(i) Are publicly available without restrictions;\\n(ii) Have been provided to the United States without restriction; or\\n(iii) Have been otherwise made available without restriction other than a release or disclosure resulting from the\\nsale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the technical data to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a\\nbusiness entity or its assets to another party.\\n(2) Pre-challenge requests for information.\\n(i) After consideration of the situations described in paragraph (d)(3) of this subsection, contracting officers may\\nrequest the person asserting a restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation for the\\nassertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer to ascertain the basis of the restrictive markings. Additional\\nsupporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided by the person making the assertion does not, in\\nthe contracting officer\\'s opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.\\n(ii) If the person asserting the restriction fails to respond to the contracting officer\\'s request for information or\\nadditional supporting documentation, or if the information submitted or any other available information pertaining to the\\nvalidity of a restrictive marking does not justify the asserted restriction, a challenge should be considered.\\n(3) Transacting matters directly with subcontractors. The clause at 252.227-7037 obtains the contractor\\'s agreement\\nthat the Government may transact matters under the clause directly with a subcontractor, at any tier, without creating\\nor implying privity of contract. Contracting officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge and\\nvalidation matters directly with the Government when—\\n(i) A subcontractor\\'s or supplier\\'s business interests in its technical data would be compromised if the data were\\ndisclosed to a higher tier contractor;\\n(ii) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely\\nresponse would jeopardize a subcontractor\\'s or supplier\\'s right to assert restrictions; or\\n(iii) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.\\n(4) Challenge notice. The contracting officer shall not issue a challenge notice unless there are reasonable grounds\\nto question the validity of an assertion. For commercial products or commercial services, also see paragraph (c)(2) of this\\nsection. The contracting officer may challenge an assertion whether or not supporting documentation was requested under\\nparagraph (d)(2) of this section. Challenge notices must be in writing and issued to the contractor or, after consideration of\\nthe situations described in paragraph (d)(3) of this subsection, the person asserting the restriction. The challenge notice must\\ninclude the information in paragraph (e) of the clause at 252.227-7037 .\\n(5) Extension of response time. The contracting officer, at his or her discretion, may extend the time for response\\ncontained in a challenge notice, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely written request showing the need for\\nadditional time to prepare a response.\\n(6) Contracting officer\\'s final decision. Contracting officers must issue a final decision for each challenged assertion,\\nwhether or not the assertion has been justified.\\n227.71-12\\n\\nSUBPART 227.71 - TECHNICAL DATA AND ASSOCIATED RIGHTS\\n227.7103-14\\n(i) A contracting officer\\'s final decision that an assertion is not justified must be issued as soon as practicable\\nfollowing the failure of the person asserting the restriction to respond to the contracting officer\\'s challenge within 60 days, or\\nany extension to that time granted by the contracting officer.\\n(ii) A contracting officer who, following a challenge and response by the person asserting the restriction, determines\\nthat an asserted restriction is justified, shall issue a final decision sustaining the validity of the asserted restriction. If the\\nasserted restriction was made subsequent to submission of the contractor\\'s offer, add the asserted restriction to the contract\\nattachment.\\n(iii) A contracting officer who determines that the validity of an asserted restriction has not been justified shall issue\\na contracting officer\\'s final decision within the time frames prescribed in 252.227-7037 . As provided in paragraph (g) of that\\nclause, the Government is obligated to continue to respect the asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal\\nunless the agency head notifies the person asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit the\\nGovernment to continue to respect the asserted restriction.\\n(7) Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction. When more than one contracting officer challenges an asserted\\nrestriction, the contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges.\\nThat contracting officer shall consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify that all challenges apply to\\nthe same asserted restriction and, after consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the restriction, issue\\na schedule that provides that person a reasonable opportunity to respond to each challenge.\\n(8) Validation. Only a contracting officer\\'s final decision, or actions of an agency board of contract appeals or a court of\\ncompetent jurisdiction, that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the asserted restriction.\\n227.7103-14 Conformity, acceptance, and warranty of technical data.\\n(a) Statutory requirements. 10 U.S.C. 3772 -\\n(1) Provides for the establishment of remedies applicable to technical data found to be incomplete, inadequate, or not to\\nsatisfy the requirements of the contract concerning such data; and\\n(2) Authorizes agency heads to withhold payments (or exercise such other remedies an agency head considers\\nappropriate) during any period if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract pertaining to the delivery of\\ntechnical data.\\n(b) Conformity and acceptance. (1) Solicitations and contracts requiring the delivery of technical data shall specify the\\nrequirements the data must satisfy to be acceptable. Contracting officers, or their authorized representatives, are responsible\\nfor determining whether technical data tendered for acceptance conform to the contractual requirements.\\n(2) The clause at 252.227-7030, Technical Data - Withholding of Payment, provides for withholding up to 10 percent\\nof the contract price pending correction or replacement of the nonconforming technical data or negotiation of an equitable\\nreduction in contract price. The amount subject to withholding may be expressed as a fixed dollar amount or as a percentage\\nof the contract price. In either case, the amount shall be determined giving consideration to the relative value and importance\\nof the data. For example -\\n(i) When the sole purpose of a contract is to produce the data, the relative value of that data may be considerably\\nhigher than the value of data produced under a contract where the production of the data is a secondary objective; or\\n(ii) When the Government will maintain or repair items, repair and maintenance data may have a considerably\\nhigher relative value than data that merely describe the item or provide performance characteristics.\\n(3) Do not accept technical data that do not conform to the contractual requirements in all respects. Except for\\nnonconforming restrictive markings (see paragraph (b)(4) of this subsection), correction or replacement of nonconforming\\ndata or an equitable reduction in contract price when correction or replacement of the nonconforming data is not practicable\\nor is not in the Government\\'s interests, shall be accomplished in accordance with -\\n(i) The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and acceptance of deliverables and remedies for\\nnonconforming deliverables; or\\n(ii) The procedures at FAR 46.407(c) through (g), if the contract does not contain an inspection clause providing\\nremedies for nonconforming deliverables.\\n(4) Follow the procedures at 227.7103-12(a)(2) if nonconforming markings are the sole reason technical data fail to\\nconform to contractual requirements. The clause at 252.227-7030 may be used to withhold an amount for payment, consistent\\nwith the terms of the clause, pending correction of the nonconforming markings.\\n(c) Warranty. (1) The intended use of the technical data and the cost, if any, to obtain the warranty should be considered\\nbefore deciding to obtain a data warranty (see FAR 46.703). The fact that a particular item, component, or process is or is\\nnot warranted is not a consideration in determining whether or not to obtain a warranty for the technical data that pertain to\\n227.71-13\\n\\n227.7103-15\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\nthe item, component, or process. For example, a data warranty should be considered if the Government intends to repair or\\nmaintain an item and defective repair or maintenance data would impair the Government\\'s effective use of the item or result\\nin increased costs to the Government.\\n(2) As prescribed in 246.710, use the clause at 252.246-7001, Warranty of Data, and its alternates, or a substantially\\nsimilar clause when the Government needs a specific warranty of technical data.\\n227.7103-15 Subcontractor rights in technical data.\\n(a) 10 U.S.C. 3771 provides subcontractors at all tiers the same protection for their rights in data as is provided to prime\\ncontractors. The clauses at 252.227-7013 , Rights in Technical Data–Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial\\nServices, and 252.227-7037 , Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, implement the statutory requirements.\\n(b) 10 U.S.C. 3782 permits a subcontractor to transact directly with the Government matters relating to the validation\\nof its asserted restrictions on the Government\\'s rights to use or disclose technical data. The clause at 252.227-7037 obtains\\na contractor\\'s agreement that the direct transaction of validation or challenge matters with subcontractors at any tier does\\nnot establish or imply privity of contract. When a subcontractor or supplier exercises its right to transact validation matters\\ndirectly with the Government, contracting officers shall deal directly with such persons, as provided at 227.7103-13 (c)(3).\\n(c) Require prime contractors whose contracts include the following clauses to include those clauses, without modification\\nexcept for appropriate identification of the parties, in contracts with subcontractors or suppliers, at all tiers, who will\\nbe furnishing technical data for other than commercial products or commercial services in response to a Government\\nrequirement:\\n(1) 252.227-7013 , Rights in Technical Data–Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services;\\n(2) 252.227-7025 , Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with\\nRestrictive Legends;\\n(3) 252.227-7028 , Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government; and\\n(4) 252.227-7037 , Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data.\\n(d) Do not require contractors to have their subcontractors or suppliers at any tier relinquish rights in technical data to the\\ncontractor, a higher tier subcontractor, or to the Government, as a condition for award of any contract, subcontract, purchase\\norder, or similar instrument except for the rights obtained by the Government under the Rights in Technical Data–Other Than\\nCommercial Products and Commercial Services clause contained in the contractor\\'s contract with the Government.\\n227.7103-16 Providing technical data to foreign governments, foreign contractors, or international organizations.\\nTechnical data may be released or disclosed to foreign governments, foreign contractors, or international organizations\\nonly if release or disclosure is otherwise permitted both by Federal export controls and other national security laws or\\nregulations. Subject to such laws and regulations, the Department of Defense—\\n(a) May release or disclose technical data in which it has obtained unlimited rights to such foreign entities or authorize the\\nuse of such data by those entities; and\\n(b) Shall not release or disclose technical data for which restrictions on use, release, or disclosure have been asserted\\nto foreign entities, or authorize the use of technical data by those entities, unless the intended recipient is subject to the\\nsame provisions as included in the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 and the requirements of the clause\\nat 252.227-7013 , Rights in Technical Data–Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, governing use,\\nmodification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such data have been satisfied.\\n227.7103-17 Overseas contracts with foreign sources.\\n(a) The clause at 252.227-7032 , Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software (Foreign), may be used in contracts\\nwith foreign contractors to be performed overseas, except Canadian purchases (see paragraph (c) of this subsection), in lieu of\\nthe clause at 252.227-7013 , Rights in Technical Data–Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, when the\\nGovernment requires the unrestricted right to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose all technical data\\nto be delivered under the contract. Do not use the clause in contracts for existing or special works.\\n(b) When the Government does not require unlimited rights, the clause at 252.227-7032 may be modified to accommodate\\nthe needs of a specific overseas procurement situation. The Government should obtain rights in the technical data that are\\nnot less than the rights the Government would have obtained under the data rights clause(s) prescribed in this part for a\\ncomparable procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.\\n(c) Contracts for Canadian purchases shall include the appropriate data rights clause prescribed in this part for a\\ncomparable procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.\\n227.71-14\\n\\nSUBPART 227.71 - TECHNICAL DATA AND ASSOCIATED RIGHTS\\n227.7105-2\\n227.7104 Contracts under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program.\\n(a) Use the clause at 252.227-7018 , Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software–Small\\nBusiness Innovation Research (SBIR) Program, when technical data or computer software will be generated during\\nperformance of contracts under the SBIR program.\\n(b) Under the clause at 252.227-7018 , the Government obtains SBIR data rights in technical data and computer software\\ngenerated under the contract and marked with the SBIR data rights legend. SBIR data rights provide the Government\\nlimited rights in such technical data and restricted rights in such computer software during the SBIR data protection period\\ncommencing with contract award and ending five years after completion of the project under which the data were generated.\\nUpon expiration of the five-year restrictive license, the Government has unlimited rights in the SBIR technical data and\\ncomputer software.\\n(c) During the SBIR data protection period, the Government may not release or disclose SBIR technical data or computer\\nsoftware to any person except as authorized for limited rights technical data or restricted rights computer software,\\nrespectively.\\n(d) Use the clause at 252.227-7018 with its Alternate I in research contracts when the contracting officer determines, in\\nconsultation with counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be—\\n(1) In the interest of the Government; and\\n(2) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish the work for sale, or to have others publish the work\\nfor sale on behalf of the Government.\\n(e) Use the following provision and clauses in SBIR solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7018 :\\n(1) 252.227-7016 , Rights in Bid or Proposal Information;\\n(2) 252.227-7017 , Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions;\\n(3) 252.227-7019 , Validation of Asserted Restrictions–Computer Software;\\n(4) 252.227-7030 , Technical Data–Withholding of Payment; and\\n(5) 252.227-7037 , Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data (paragraph (e) of the clause contains\\ninformation that must be included in a challenge).\\n(f) Use the following clauses and provision in SBIR solicitations and contracts in accordance with the guidance at\\n227.7103-6 (c) and (d):\\n(1) 252.227-7025 , Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with\\nRestrictive Legends; and\\n(2) 252.227-7028 , Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government.\\n227.7105 Contracts for the acquisition of existing works.\\n227.7105-1 General.\\n(a) Existing works include motion pictures, television recordings, video recordings, and other audiovisual works in any\\nmedium; sound recordings in any medium; musical, dramatic, and literary works; pantomimes and choreographic works;\\npictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; and works of a similar nature. Usually, these or similar works were not first created,\\ndeveloped, generated, originated, prepared, or produced under a Government contract. Therefore, the Government must\\nobtain a license in the work if it intends to reproduce the work, distribute copies of the work, prepare derivative works, or\\nperform or display the work publicly. When the Government is not responsible for the content of an existing work, it should\\nrequire the copyright owner to indemnify the Government for liabilities that may arise out of the content, performance, use,\\nor disclosure of such data.\\n(b) Follow the procedures at 227.7106 for works which will be first created, developed, generated, originated, prepared, or\\nproduced under a Government contract and the Government needs to control distribution of the work or has a specific need to\\nobtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the creation, content, performance, use, or disclosure of the work or from\\nlibelous or other unlawful material contained in the work. Follow the procedures at 227.7103 when the Government does not\\nneed to control distribution of such works or obtain such indemnities.\\n227.7105-2 Acquisition of existing works without modification.\\n(a) Use the clause at 252.227-7021 , Rights in Data–Existing Works, in lieu of the clause at 252.227-7013 , Rights in\\nTechnical Data–Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, in solicitations and contracts exclusively for\\nexisting works when—\\n(1) The existing works will be acquired without modification; and\\n227.71-15\\n\\n227.7105-3\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(2) The Government requires the right to reproduce, prepare derivative works, or publicly perform or display the\\nexisting works; or\\n(3) The Government has a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the content,\\nperformance, use, or disclosure of such data.\\n(b) The clause at 252.227-7021 provides the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, non-exclusive,\\nirrevocable, world-wide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works and publicly perform or display the works called for\\nby a contract and to authorize others to do so for government purposes.\\n(c) A contract clause is not required to acquire existing works such as books, magazines and periodicals, in any storage or\\nretrieval medium, when the Government will not reproduce the books, magazines or periodicals, or prepare derivative works.\\n227.7105-3 Acquisition of modified existing works.\\nUse the clause at 252.227-7020 , Rights in Special Works, in solicitations and contracts for modified existing works in lieu\\nof the clause at 252.227-7021 , Rights in Data–Existing Works.\\n227.7106 Contracts for special works.\\n(a) Use the clause at 252.227-7020 , Rights in Special Works, in solicitations and contracts where the Government has a\\nspecific need to control the distribution of works first produced, created, or generated in the performance of a contract and\\nrequired to be delivered under that contract, including controlling distribution by obtaining an assignment of copyright, or a\\nspecific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the creation, delivery, use, modification, reproduction,\\nrelease, performance, display, or disclosure of such works. Use the clause—\\n(1) In lieu of the clause at 252.227-7013 , Rights in Technical Data–Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial\\nServices, when the Government must own or control copyright in all works first produced, created, or generated and required\\nto be delivered under a contract; or\\n(2) In addition to the clause at 252.227-7013 when the Government must own or control copyright in a portion of a\\nwork first produced, created, or generated and required to be delivered under a contract. The specific portion in which the\\nGovernment must own or control copyright must be identified in a special contract requirement.\\n(b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and unlimited rights in a special work under the clause at\\n252.227-7020 , the contractor retains use and disclosure rights in that work. If the Government needs to restrict a contractor\\'s\\nrights to use or disclose a special work, it must also negotiate a special license which specifically restricts the contractor\\'s use\\nor disclosure rights.\\n(c) The clause at 252.227-7020 does not permit a contractor to incorporate into a special work any works copyrighted\\nby others unless the contractor obtains the contracting officer\\'s permission to do so and obtains for the Government a non-\\nexclusive, paid up, world-wide license to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works, to perform or\\ndisplay publicly any portion of the work, and to permit others to do so for government purposes.

To the maximum extent practicable, when assessing the life-cycle needs, data managers or\\nother requirements personnel will address in the procurement planning and requirements documents (e.g., acquisition plans,\\npurchase requests) the acquisition at appropriate times in the life cycle of all computer software, related recorded information,\\nand associated license rights necessary to—\\n(A) Reproduce, build, or recompile the software from its source code and required software libraries (e.g.,\\nsoftware libraries called, invoked, or linked by the computer software source code that are necessary for the operation of the\\nsoftware);\\n(B) Conduct required computer software testing and evaluation;\\n(C) Integrate and deploy computer programs on relevant hardware including developmental, operational,\\ndiagnostic, training, or simulation environments; and\\n(D) Sustain and support the software over its life cycle.\\n(ii) Alternatives to delivery of source code and related software design details. The assessment of life-cycle needs\\nshould consider alternatives to the delivery of source code and related software design details for privately developed\\ncomputer software as necessary to meet the Government’s needs, such as—\\n(A) Technical data and computer software sufficient to implement a modular open system approach or a similar\\napproach (see PGI 227.7203-2(b)(2)(ii)(A) (DFARS/PGI view) for guidance on alternatives to source code and related\\nsoftware design details);\\n(B) Access to technical data or computer software, including access agreements for cloud-based or subscription-\\nbased software products or services; see PGI 227.7203-2(b)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) (DFARS/PGI view) for guidance on use of\\naccess agreements to contractor source code and related software design details;\\n(C) Software support and maintenance provided directly from the contractor; or\\n(D) Other contracting or licensing mechanisms including priced options, specially negotiated licenses, direct\\nlicensing between contractors for qualifying second sources, data escrow agreements, deferred delivery solutions, and\\nsubscription agreements. See PGI 227.7203-2(b)(2)(ii)(D) (DFARS/PGI view) for guidance on use of escrow agreements.\\n(3) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or other request for computer software or computer\\nsoftware documentation, data managers must balance the original assessment of the Government\\'s needs with prices offered.\\n(c) Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that, wherever practicable, solicitations and contracts—\\n(1) Identify the types of computer software and the quantity of computer programs and computer software\\ndocumentation to be delivered, any requirements for multiple users at one site or multiple site licenses, and the format and\\nmedia in which the software or documentation will be delivered;\\n(2) Establish each type of computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered as a separate contract\\nline item (this requirement may be satisfied by an exhibit to the contract);\\n(3) Identify the prices established for each separately priced deliverable item of computer software or computer\\nsoftware documentation under a fixed-price type contract;\\n(4) Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each deliverable item;\\n(5) Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable item; and\\n(6) Specify in the negotiated terms that any required other than commercial computer software, related recorded\\ninformation, and associated license rights identified in the assessment of life-cycle needs in paragraph (b) of this section shall\\nto the extent appropriate—\\n(i) Include computer software delivered in a digital format compatible with applicable computer programs on\\nrelevant system hardware;\\n(ii) Not rely on additional internal or external other than commercial or commercial technical data and software,\\nunless such technical data or software is—\\n(A) Included in the items to be delivered with license rights sufficient to meet the Government’s needs; or\\n(B) Commercially available with license rights sufficient to meet the Government’s needs; and\\n(iii) Include sufficient information, with license rights sufficient to meet the Government’s needs, to support\\nmaintenance and understanding of interfaces and software version history when the negotiated terms do not allow for the\\ninclusion of the external or additional other than commercial or commercial technical data and software.\\n227.7203-3 Early identification of computer software or computer software documentation to be furnished to the\\nGovernment with restrictions on use, reproduction, or disclosure.\\n(a) Use the provision at 252.227-7017 , Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, in all\\nsolicitations that include the clause at 252.227-7014 , Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other\\n227.72-3\\n\\n227.7203-4\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\nThan Commercial Computer Software Documentation. The provision requires offerors to identify any computer software or\\ncomputer software documentation for which restrictions, other than copyright, on use, modification, reproduction, release,\\nperformance, display, or disclosure are asserted and to attach the identification and assertion to the offer.\\n(b) Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7014 permits a contractor, under certain conditions, to make\\nadditional assertions of restrictions. The prescriptions for the use of that clause and its alternates are at 227.7203-6 (a).\\n227.7203-4 License rights.\\n(a) Grant of license. The Government obtains rights in computer software or computer software documentation, including\\na copyright license, under an irrevocable license granted or obtained by the contractor which developed the software or\\ndocumentation or the licensor of the software or documentation if the development contractor is not the licensor. The\\ncontractor or licensor retains all rights in the software or documentation not granted to the Government. The scope of a\\ncomputer software license is generally determined by the source of funds used to develop the software. Contractors or\\nlicensors may, with some exceptions, restrict the Government\\'s rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or\\ndisclose computer software developed exclusively or partially at private expense (see 227.7203-5 (b) and (c)). They may not,\\nwithout the Government\\'s agreement (see 227.7203-5 (d)), restrict the Government\\'s rights in computer software developed\\nexclusively with Government funds or in computer software documentation required to be delivered under a contract.\\n(b) Source of funds determination. The determination of the source of funds used to develop computer software should be\\nmade at the lowest practicable segregable portion of the software or documentation (e.g., a software sub-routine that performs\\na specific function). Contractors may assert restricted rights in a segregable portion of computer software which otherwise\\nqualifies for restricted rights under the clause at 252.227-7014 , Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and\\nOther Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation.\\n227.7203-5 Government rights.\\nThe standard license rights in computer software that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government\\npurpose rights, or restricted rights. The standard license in computer software documentation conveys unlimited rights.\\nThose rights are defined in the clause at 252.227-7014 , Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other\\nThan Commercial Computer Software Documentation. In unusual situations, the standard rights may not satisfy the\\nGovernment\\'s needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in return for other consideration. In those cases,\\na special license may be negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater rights and\\nthe contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license. The\\nsituations under which a particular grant of license applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.\\n(a) Unlimited rights. The Government obtains an unlimited rights license in—\\n(1) Computer software developed exclusively with Government funds;\\n(2) Computer software documentation required to be delivered under a Government contract;\\n(3) Corrections or changes to computer software or computer software documentation furnished to the contractor by the\\nGovernment;\\n(4) Computer software or computer software documentation that is otherwise publicly available or has been released\\nor disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure other than a release\\nor disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to another party or the sale or\\ntransfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party;\\n(5) Computer software or computer software documentation obtained with unlimited rights under another Government\\ncontract or as a result of negotiations; or\\n(6) Computer software or computer software documentation furnished to the Government, under a Government\\ncontract or subcontract with—\\n(i) Restricted rights in computer software, limited rights in technical data, or government purpose license rights and\\nthe restrictive conditions have expired; or\\n(ii) Government purpose rights and the contractor\\'s exclusive right to use such software or documentation for\\ncommercial purposes has expired.\\n(b) Government purpose rights.\\n(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the Government obtains government purpose rights in\\ncomputer software developed with mixed funding.\\n(2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective is negotiable. The clause at 252.227-7014\\nprovides a nominal five-year period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the government purpose rights\\n227.72-4\\n\\nSUBPART 227.72 - COMPUTER SOFTWARE, COMPUTER SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION, AND ASSOCIATED RIGHTS\\n227.7203-5\\nperiod may be made at any time prior to delivery of the software without consideration from either party. Longer periods\\nshould be negotiated when a five-year period does not provide sufficient time to commercialize the software or, for software\\ndeveloped by subcontractors, when necessary to recognize the subcontractors\\' interests in the software.\\n(3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or\\nsimilar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required development of the computer software.\\nUpon expiration of the government purpose rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the software including the\\nright to authorize others to use the data for commercial purposes.\\n(4) During the government purpose rights period, the Government may not use, or authorize other persons to use,\\ncomputer software marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The Government shall not\\nrelease or disclose, or authorize others to release or disclose, computer software in which it has government purpose rights to\\nany person unless—\\n(i) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at\\n227.7103-7 ; or\\n(ii) The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving access to the software for performance of a\\nGovernment contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025 , Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-\\nFurnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.\\n(5) When computer software marked with government purpose rights legends will be released or disclosed to a\\nGovernment contractor performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252.227-7025 , the contract may be\\nmodified, prior to release or disclosure, to include such clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and non-\\ndisclosure agreement.\\n(6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that computer software or computer software\\ndocumentation marked with government purpose rights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure\\nthrough a Government solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and non-disclosure restrictions. Public announcements\\nin the Commerce Business Daily or other publications must provide notice of the use and non-disclosure requirements.\\nClass use and non-disclosure agreements (e.g., agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a\\nreasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose\\nrights software or documentation. Documents transmitting government purpose rights software or documentation to persons\\nunder class agreements shall identify the specific software or documentation subject to government purpose rights and the\\nclass agreement under which such software or documentation are provided.\\n(c) Restricted rights.\\n(1) The Government obtains restricted rights in other than commercial computer software, required to be delivered or\\notherwise provided to the Government under a contract, that was developed exclusively at private expense.\\n(2) Contractors are not required to provide the Government additional rights in computer software delivered or\\notherwise provided to the Government with restricted rights. When the Government has a need for additional rights, the\\nGovernment must negotiate with the contractor to determine if there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. List or\\ndescribe all software in which the contractor has granted the Government additional rights in a license agreement made part\\nof the contract (see paragraph (d) of this subsection). The license shall enumerate the specific additional rights granted to the\\nGovernment.\\n(d) Specifically negotiated license rights. Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license\\nrights granted to the Government or when the Government wants to obtain rights in computer software in which it does not\\nhave rights. When negotiating to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government\\'s rights in computer software, consider the\\nplanned software maintenance philosophy, anticipated time or user sharing requirements, and other factors which may have\\nrelevance for a particular procurement. If negotiating to relinquish rights in computer software documentation, consider\\nthe administrative burden associated with protecting documentation subject to restrictions from unauthorized release or\\ndisclosure. The negotiated license rights must stipulate the rights granted the Government to use, modify, reproduce, release,\\nperform, display, or disclose the software or documentation and the extent to which the Government may authorize others to\\ndo so. Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of the contract.\\n(e) Rights in derivative computer software or computer software documentation. The clause at 252.227-7014 protects\\nthe Government\\'s rights in computer software, computer software documentation, or portions thereof that the contractor\\nsubsequently uses to prepare derivative software or subsequently embeds or includes in other software or documentation.\\nThe Government retains the rights it obtained under the development contract in the unmodified portions of the derivative\\nsoftware or documentation.\\n227.72-5\\n\\n227.7203-6\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n227.7203-6 Contract clauses.\\n(a)(1) Use the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial\\nComputer Software Documentation, in solicitations and contracts when the successful offeror(s) will be required to deliver\\ncomputer software or computer software documentation. Do not use the clause when the only deliverable items are technical\\ndata (other than computer software documentation), commercial computer software or commercial computer software\\ndocumentation, commercial products, commercial services (see 227.7102-3), special works (see 227.7205), or contracts\\nunder the Small Business Innovation Research Program (see 227.7104). Except as provided in 227.7107-2, do not use the\\nclause in architect-engineer and construction contracts.\\n(2) Use the clause at 252.227-7014 with its Alternate I in research contracts when the contracting officer determines, in\\nconsultation with counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be—\\n(i) In the interest of the Government; and\\n(ii) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish the work for sale, or to have others publish the\\nwork for sale on behalf of the Government.\\n(b) Use the clause at 252.227-7016 , Rights in Bid or Proposal Information, in solicitations and contracts that include the\\nclause at 252.227-7014 .\\n(c) Use the clause at 252.227-7019 , Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, in solicitations and\\ncontracts that include the clause at 252.227-7014 . The clause provides procedures for the validation of asserted restrictions\\non the Government\\'s rights to use, release, or disclose computer software.\\n(d) Use the clause at 252.227-7025 , Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked\\nwith Restrictive Legends, in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the Government will provide the contractor\\n(other than a litigation support contractor covered by 252.204-7014 ), for performance of its contract, computer software or\\ncomputer software documentation marked with another contractor\\'s restrictive legend(s).\\n(e) Use the provision at 252.227-7028 , Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government,\\nin solicitations when the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver computer software or computer software\\ndocumentation. The provision requires offerors to identify any software or documentation specified in the solicitation as\\ndeliverable items that are the same or substantially the same as software or documentation which the offeror has delivered or\\nis obligated to deliver, either as a contractor or subcontractor, under any other federal agency contract.\\n(f) Use the clause at 252.227-7037 , Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, in solicitations and contracts\\nthat include the clause at 252.227-7014 when the contractor will be required to deliver other than commercial computer\\nsoftware documentation (technical data). The clause implements statutory requirements under 10 U.S.C. 3781-3786.\\nParagraph (e) of the clause contains information that must be included in a formal challenge.\\n227.7203-8 Deferred delivery and deferred ordering of computer software and computer software documentation.\\n(a) Deferred delivery. Use the clause at 252.227-7026 , Deferred Delivery of Technical Data or Computer Software, when\\nit is in the Government\\'s interests to defer the delivery of computer software or computer software documentation. The clause\\npermits the contracting officer to require the delivery of data identified as “deferred delivery” data or computer software at\\nany time until two years after acceptance by the Government of all items (other than technical data or computer software)\\nunder the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers to deliver such\\ndata expires two years after the date the prime contractor accepts the last item from the subcontractor or supplier for use in\\nthe performance of the contract. The contract must specify the computer software or computer software documentation that is\\nsubject to deferred delivery. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor sufficiently in advance of the desired delivery\\ndate for such software or documentation to permit timely delivery.\\n(b) Deferred ordering. Use the clause at 252.227-7027 , Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software, when\\na firm requirement for software or documentation has not been established prior to contract award but there is a potential\\nneed for computer software or computer software documentation. Under this clause, the contracting officer may order any\\ncomputer software or computer software documentation generated in the performance of the contract or any subcontract\\nthereunder at any time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under\\nthe contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to deliver such technical data or\\ncomputer software expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last item under the subcontract. When the\\nsoftware or documentation are ordered, the delivery dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated only for\\nconverting the software or documentation into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, and delivery costs.\\n227.72-6\\n\\nSUBPART 227.72 - COMPUTER SOFTWARE, COMPUTER SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION, AND ASSOCIATED RIGHTS\\n227.7203-10\\n227.7203-9 Copyright.\\n(a) Copyright license.\\n(1) The clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial\\nComputer Software Documentation, requires a contractor to grant, or obtain for the Government license rights which\\npermit the Government to reproduce the software or documentation, distribute copies, perform or display the software or\\ndocumentation and, through the right to modify data, prepare derivative works. The extent to which the Government, and\\nothers acting on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard data rights licenses obtained under the\\nclause. When non-standard license rights in computer software or computer software documentation will be negotiated,\\nnegotiate the extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not negotiate\\ncopyright licenses for computer software that provide less rights than the standard restricted rights in computer software\\nlicense. For computer software documentation, do not negotiate a copyright license that provides less rights than the standard\\nlimited rights in technical data license.\\n(2) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, does not\\npermit a contractor to incorporate a third party\\'s copyrighted software into a deliverable software item unless the contractor\\nhas obtained an appropriate license for the Government and, when applicable, others acting on the Government\\'s behalf, or\\nhas obtained the contracting officer\\'s written approval to do so. Grant approval to use third party copyrighted software in\\nwhich the Government will not receive a copyright license only when the Government\\'s requirements cannot be satisfied\\nwithout the third party material or when the use of the third party material will result in cost savings to the Government which\\noutweigh the lack of a copyright license.\\n(b) Copyright considerations-special works. See 227.7205 for copyright considerations when acquiring special works.\\n227.7203-10 Contractor identification and marking of computer software or computer software documentation to be\\nfurnished with restrictive markings.\\n(a) Identification requirements.\\n(1) The solicitation provision at 252.227-7017 , Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure\\nRestrictions, requires offerors to identify, prior to contract award, any computer software or computer software\\ndocumentation that an offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with restrictions on use, modification,\\nreproduction, release, or disclosure. This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright. The\\nnotification and identification must be submitted as an attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the attachment or\\nfails to complete the attachment in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute\\na minor informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR\\n14.405 or 15.306(a). An offeror\\'s failure to correct an informality within the time prescribed by the contracting officer shall\\nrender the offer ineligible for award.\\n(2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be used to obtain information regarding asserted\\nrestrictions or an offeror\\'s suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the justification for an asserted restriction\\nor asserted rights category must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.7203-13 .\\n(3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be attached to its contract unless, in accordance with the\\nprocedures at 227.7203-13 , the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not justified. The contract attachment\\nshall provide the same information regarding identification of the computer software or computer software documentation,\\nthe asserted rights category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person asserting the restrictions as required by\\nparagraph (d) of the solicitation provision at 252.227-7017 . Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7014 ,\\nRights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation,\\npermits a contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The additional assertions must be made in\\naccordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.\\n(4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor nor the fact that certain assertions are identified in\\nthe attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As provided at 227.7203-13 , the Government\\nhas the right to review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.\\n(5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation provision at 252.227-7017 may be used in the\\nsource selection process to evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the Government\\'s\\nability to use or disclose computer software or computer software documentation.\\n(b) Contractor marking requirements. The clause at 252.227-7014 , Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software\\nand Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation—\\n227.72-7\\n\\n227.7203-11\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(1) Requires a contractor who desires to restrict the Government\\'s rights in computer software or computer software\\ndocumentation to place restrictive markings on the software or documentation, provides instructions for the placement of the\\nrestrictive markings, and authorizes the use of certain restrictive markings. When it is anticipated that the software will or\\nmay be used in combat or situations which simulate combat conditions, do not permit contractors to insert instructions into\\ncomputer programs that interfere with or delay operation of the software to display a restrictive rights legend or other license\\nnotice; and\\n(2) Requires a contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide to the Government any computer software or\\ncomputer software documentation in which the Government has previously obtained rights with the Government\\'s pre-\\nexisting rights in that software or documentation unless the parties have agreed otherwise or restrictions on the Government\\'s\\nrights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose the software or documentation have expired. When restrictions are still\\napplicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the software or documentation with the appropriate restrictive legend.\\n(c) Unmarked computer software or computer software documentation.\\n(1) Computer software or computer software documentation delivered or otherwise provided under a contract without\\nrestrictive markings shall be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights and may be released or disclosed without\\nrestriction. To the extent practicable, if a contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (c)(2) of this subsection) to\\ncorrect an inadvertent omission of markings, do not release or disclose the software or documentation pending evaluation of\\nthe request.\\n(2) A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends placed on unmarked computer software or\\ncomputer software documentation at its expense. The request must be received by the contracting officer within six months\\nfollowing the furnishing or delivery of such software or documentation, or any extension of that time approved by the\\ncontracting officer. The person making the request must—\\n(i) Identify the software or documentation that should have been marked;\\n(ii) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the proposed marking is justified and conforms\\nwith the requirements for the marking of computer software or computer software documentation contained in the clause at\\n252.227-7014 ; and\\n(iii) Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability with respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or\\nuse of the software or documentation made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the omission of the marking.\\n(3) Contracting officers should grant permission to mark only if the software or documentation were not distributed\\noutside the Government or were distributed outside the Government with restrictions on further use or disclosure.\\n227.7203-11 Contractor procedures and records.\\n(a) The clause at 252.227-7014 , Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial\\nComputer Software Documentation, requires a contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver computer\\nsoftware or computer software documentation with other than unlimited rights, to establish and follow written procedures\\nto assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain records to justify the validity of restrictive\\nmarkings.\\n(b) The clause at 252.227-7019 , Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, requires contractors and their\\nsubcontractors or suppliers at any tier to maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of markings that assert restrictions\\non the use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of computer software.\\n227.7203-12 Government right to establish conformity of markings.\\n(a) Nonconforming markings.\\n(1) Authorized markings are identified in the clause at 252.227-7014 , Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer\\nSoftware and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation. All other markings are nonconforming markings.\\nAn authorized marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from the marking requirements in the clause at\\n252.227-7014 is also a nonconforming marking.\\n(2) The correction of nonconforming markings on computer software is not subject to 252.227-7019 , Validation\\nof Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, and the correction of nonconforming markings on computer software\\ndocumentation (technical data) is not subject to 252.227-7037 , Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data. To\\nthe extent practicable, the contracting officer should return computer software or computer software documentation bearing\\nnonconforming markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on the software or documentation\\nto provide that person an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming markings at that person\\'s expense. If that\\nperson fails to correct the nonconformity and return the corrected software or documentation within 60 days following the\\n227.72-8\\n\\nSUBPART 227.72 - COMPUTER SOFTWARE, COMPUTER SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION, AND ASSOCIATED RIGHTS\\n227.7203-13\\nperson\\'s receipt of the software or documentation, the contracting officer may correct or strike the nonconformity at that\\nperson\\'s expense. When it is impracticable to return computer software or computer software documentation for correction,\\ncontracting officers may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government expense. Prior to correction, the\\nsoftware or documentation may be used in accordance with the proper restrictive marking.\\n(b) Unjustified markings.\\n(1) An unjustified marking is an authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions applicable to the\\nGovernment\\'s use, modification, reproduction, release, or disclosure of the marked computer software or computer software\\ndocumentation. For example, a restricted rights legend placed on computer software developed under a Government contract\\neither exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations under which the Government obtains unlimited\\nor government purpose rights) is an unjustified marking.\\n(2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the validity of unjustified markings. However, at any\\ntime during performance of a contract and notwithstanding existence of a challenge, the contracting officer and the person\\nwho has asserted a restrictive marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon such agreement, the\\ncontracting officer may, at his or her election, either—\\n(i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person\\'s expense; or\\n(ii) Return the computer software or computer software documentation to the person asserting the restriction for\\ncorrection at that person\\'s expense. If the software or documentation are returned and that person fails to correct or strike the\\nunjustified restriction and return the corrected software or documentation to the contracting officer within 60 days following\\nreceipt of the software or documentation, the unjustified marking shall be corrected or stricken at that person\\'s expense.\\n227.7203-13 Government right to review, verify, challenge, and validate asserted restrictions.\\n(a) General. An offeror\\'s or contractor\\'s assertion(s) of restrictions on the Government\\'s rights to use, modify, reproduce,\\nrelease, or disclose computer software or computer software documentation do not, by themselves, determine the extent of\\nthe Government\\'s rights in such software or documentation. The Government may require an offeror or contractor to submit\\nsufficient information to permit an evaluation of a particular asserted restriction and may challenge asserted restrictions when\\nthere are reasonable grounds to believe that an assertion is not valid.\\n(b) Requests for information. Contracting officers should have a reason to suspect that an asserted restriction might not\\nbe correct prior to requesting information. When requesting information, provide the offeror or contractor the reason(s) for\\nsuspecting that an asserted restriction might not be correct. A need for additional license rights is not, by itself, a sufficient\\nbasis for requesting information concerning an asserted restriction. Follow the procedures at 227.7203-5 (d) when additional\\nlicense rights are needed but there is no basis to suspect that an asserted restriction might not be valid.\\n(c) Transacting matters directly with subcontractors. The clause at 252.227-7019 , Validation of Asserted Restrictions—\\nComputer Software, obtains the contractor\\'s agreement that the Government may transact matters under the clause directly\\nwith a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting officers should\\npermit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge and validation matters directly with the Government when—\\n(1) A subcontractor\\'s or supplier\\'s business interests in its technical data would be compromised if the data were\\ndisclosed to a higher tier contractor;\\n(2) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely\\nresponse would jeopardize a subcontractor\\'s or supplier\\'s right to assert restrictions; or\\n(3) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.\\n(d) Challenging asserted restrictions.\\n(1) Pre-award considerations. The challenge procedures in the clause at 252.227-7019 could significantly delay\\ncompetitive procurements. Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award unless\\nresolution of the assertion is essential for successful completion of the procurement.\\n(2) Computer software documentation. Computer software documentation is technical data. Challenges to asserted\\nrestrictions on the Government\\'s rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software\\ndocumentation must be made in accordance with the clause at 252.227-7037 , Validation of Restrictive Markings on\\nTechnical Data, and the guidance at 227.7103-13 . The procedures in the clause at 252.227-7037 implement requirements\\ncontained in 10 U.S.C. 3781-3786. Resolution of questions regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process\\ndescribed at 227.7103-12 (b)(2) is strongly encouraged.\\n(3) Computer software.\\n(i) Asserted restrictions should be reviewed before acceptance of the computer software deliverable under a contract.\\nThe Government\\'s right to challenge an assertion expires three years after final payment under the contract or three years\\n227.72-9\\n\\n227.7203-14\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\nafter delivery of the software, whichever is later. Those limitations on the Government\\'s challenge rights do not apply to\\nsoftware that is publicly available, has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made\\navailable without restrictions.\\n(ii) Contracting officers must have reasonable grounds to challenge the current validity of an asserted restriction.\\nBefore challenging an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information pertaining to the asserted restrictions.\\nResolution of questions regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process described at 227.7203-12 (b)(2) is\\nstrongly encouraged. After consideration of the situations described in paragraph (c) of this subsection, contracting officers\\nmay request the person asserting a restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation\\nfor the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer to determine the validity of the assertion. Additional\\nsupporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided by that person does not, in the contracting\\nofficer\\'s opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.\\n(iii) Assertions may be challenged whether or not supporting documentation was requested. Challenges must be in\\nwriting and issued to the person asserting the restriction.\\n(4) Extension of response time. The contracting officer, at his or her discretion, may extend the time for response\\ncontained in a challenge, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely written request showing the need for additional\\ntime to prepare a response.\\n(e) Validating or denying asserted restrictions.\\n(1) Contracting officers must promptly issue a final decision denying or sustaining the validity of each challenged\\nassertion unless the parties have agreed on the disposition of the assertion. When a final decision denying the validity of an\\nasserted restriction is made following a timely response to a challenge, the Government is obligated to continue to respect the\\nasserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the agency head notifies the person asserting the restriction\\nthat urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction. See\\n252.227-7019 (g) for restrictions applicable following a determination of urgent and compelling circumstances.\\n(2) Only a contracting officer\\'s final decision, or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of\\ncompetent jurisdiction, that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction.\\n(f) Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction. When more than one contracting officer challenges an asserted\\nrestriction, the contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges.\\nThat contracting officer shall consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify that all challenges apply to\\nthe same asserted restriction and, after consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the restriction, issue\\na schedule that provides that person a reasonable opportunity to respond to each challenge.\\n227.7203-14 Conformity, acceptance, and warranty of computer software and computer software documentation.\\n(a) Computer software documentation. Computer software documentation is technical data. See 227.7103-14 for\\nappropriate guidance and statutory requirements.\\n(b) Computer software.\\n(1) Conformity and acceptance. Solicitations and contracts requiring the delivery of computer software shall specify\\nthe requirements the software must satisfy to be acceptable. Contracting officers, or their authorized representatives, are\\nresponsible for determining whether computer software tendered for acceptance conforms to the contractual requirements.\\nExcept for nonconforming restrictive markings (follow the procedures at 227.7203-12 (a) if nonconforming markings are the\\nsole reason computer software tendered for acceptance fails to conform to contractual requirements), do not accept software\\nthat does not conform in all respects to applicable contractual requirements. Correction or replacement of nonconforming\\nsoftware, or an equitable reduction in contract price when correction or replacement of the nonconforming data is not\\npracticable or is not in the Government\\'s interests, shall be accomplished in accordance with—\\n(i) The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and acceptance of deliverables and remedies for\\nnonconforming deliverables; or\\n(ii) The procedures at FAR 46.407(c) through (g), if the contract does not contain an inspection clause providing\\nremedies for nonconforming deliverables.\\n(2) Warranties.\\n(i) Weapon systems. Computer software that is a component of a weapon system or major subsystem should be\\nwarranted as part of the weapon system warranty. Follow the procedures at 246.7.\\n(ii) Non-weapon systems. Approval of the chief of the contracting office must be obtained to use a computer\\nsoftware warranty other than a weapon system warranty. Consider the factors at FAR 46.703 in deciding whether to obtain a\\ncomputer software warranty. When approval for a warranty has been obtained, the clause at 252.246-7001 , Warranty of Data,\\n227.72-10\\n\\nSUBPART 227.72 - COMPUTER SOFTWARE, COMPUTER SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION, AND ASSOCIATED RIGHTS\\n227.7203-17\\nand its alternates, may be appropriately modified for use with computer software or a procurement specific clause may be\\ndeveloped.\\n227.7203-15 Subcontractor rights in computer software or computer software documentation.\\n(a) Subcontractors and suppliers at all tiers should be provided the same protection for their rights in computer software or\\ncomputer software documentation as are provided to prime contractors.\\n(b) The clauses at 252.227-7019 , Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, and 252.227-7037 ,\\nValidation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, obtain a contractor\\'s agreement that the Government\\'s transaction\\nof validation or challenge matters directly with subcontractors at any tier does not establish or imply privity of contract.\\nWhen a subcontractor or supplier exercises its right to transact validation matters directly with the Government, contracting\\nofficers shall deal directly with such persons, as provided at 227.7203-13 (c) for computer software and 227.7103-13 (c)(3)\\nfor computer software documentation (technical data).\\n(c) Require prime contractors whose contracts include the following clauses to include those clauses, without modification\\nexcept for appropriate identification of the parties, in contracts with subcontractors or suppliers who will be furnishing\\ncomputer software in response to a Government requirement (see 227.7103-15 (c) for clauses required when subcontractors\\nor suppliers will be furnishing computer software documentation (technical data)):\\n(1) 252.227-7014 , Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer\\nSoftware Documentation;\\n(2) 252.227-7019 , Validation of Asserted Restrictions–Computer Software;\\n(3) 252.227-7025 , Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished Information Marked with\\nRestrictive Legends; and\\n(4) 252.227-7028 , Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government.\\n(d) Do not require contractors to have their subcontractors or suppliers at any tier relinquish rights in technical data to the\\ncontractor, a higher tier subcontractor, or to the Government, as a condition for award of any contract, subcontract, purchase\\norder, or similar instrument except for the rights obtained by the Government under the provisions of the Rights in Other\\nThan Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation clause contained in\\nthe contractor\\'s contract with the Government.\\n227.7203-16 Providing computer software or computer software documentation to foreign governments, foreign\\ncontractors, or international organizations.\\nComputer software or computer software documentation may be released or disclosed to foreign governments, foreign\\ncontractors, or international organizations only if release or disclosure is otherwise permitted both by Federal export controls\\nand other national security laws or regulations. Subject to such laws and regulations, the Department of Defense—\\n(a) May release or disclose computer software or computer software documentation in which it has obtained unlimited\\nrights to such foreign entities or authorize the use of such data by those entities; and\\n(b) Shall not release or disclose computer software or computer software documentation for which restrictions on use,\\nrelease, or disclosure have been asserted to such foreign entities or authorize the use of such data by those entities, unless\\nthe intended recipient is subject to the same provisions as included in the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7\\nand the requirements of the clause at 252.227-7014 , Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than\\nCommercial Computer Software Documentation, governing use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or\\ndisclosure of such data have been satisfied.\\n227.7203-17 Overseas contracts with foreign sources.\\n(a) The clause at 252.227-7032 , Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software (Foreign), may be used in contracts\\nwith foreign contractors to be performed overseas, except Canadian purchases (see paragraph (c) of this subsection) in lieu of\\nthe clause at 252.227-7014 , Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer\\nSoftware Documentation, when the Government requires the unrestricted right to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform,\\ndisplay, or disclose all computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered under the contract. Do not use\\nthe clause in contracts for special works.\\n(b) When the Government does not require unlimited rights, the clause at 252.227-7032 may be modified to accommodate\\nthe needs of a specific overseas procurement situation. The Government should obtain rights to the computer software or\\ncomputer software documentation that are not less than the rights the Government would have obtained under the software\\nrights clause(s) prescribed in this part for a comparable procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.\\n227.72-11\\n\\n227.7204\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(c) Contracts for Canadian purchases shall include the appropriate software rights clause prescribed in this part for a\\ncomparable procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.\\n227.7204 Contracts under the Small Business Innovation Research Program.\\nWhen contracting under the Small Business Innovation Research Program, follow the procedures at 227.7104 .\\n227.7205 Contracts for special works.\\n(a) Use the clause at 252.227-7020 , Rights in Special Works, in solicitations and contracts where the Government\\nhas a specific need to control the distribution of computer software or computer software documentation first produced,\\ncreated, or generated in the performance of a contract and required to be delivered under that contract, including controlling\\ndistribution by obtaining an assignment of copyright, or a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out\\nof the creation, delivery, use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such software or\\ndocumentation. Use the clause—\\n(1) In lieu of the clause at 252.227-7014 , Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than\\nCommercial Computer Software Documentation, when the Government must own or control copyright in all computer\\nsoftware or computer software documentation first produced, created, or generated and required to be delivered under a\\ncontract; or\\n(2) In addition to the clause at 252.227-7014 when the Government must own or control copyright in some of the\\ncomputer software or computer software documentation first produced, created, or generated and required to be delivered\\nunder a contract. The specific software or documentation in which the Government must own or control copyright must be\\nidentified in a special contract requirement.\\n(b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and unlimited rights in the computer software or\\ncomputer software documentation delivered as a special work under the clause at 252.227-7020 , the contractor retains use\\nand disclosure rights in that software or documentation. If the Government needs to restrict a contractor\\'s rights to use or\\ndisclose a special work, it must also negotiate a special license which specifically restricts the contractor\\'s use or disclosure\\nrights.\\n(c) The clause at 252.227-7020 does not permit a contractor to incorporate into a special work any work copyrighted\\nby others unless the contractor obtains the contracting officer\\'s permission to do so and obtains for the Government a non-\\nexclusive, paid up, world-wide license to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works, to perform\\nor display any portion of that work, and to permit others to do so for government purposes. Grant permission only when the\\nGovernment\\'s requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party work is included in the deliverable work.\\n(d) Examples of other works which may be procured under the clause at 252.227-7020 include, but are not limited\\nto, audiovisual works, scripts, soundtracks, musical compositions, and adaptations; histories of departments, agencies,\\nservices or units thereof; surveys of Government establishments; instructional works or guidance to Government officers\\nand employees on the discharge of their official duties; reports, books, studies, surveys or similar documents; collections of\\ndata containing information pertaining to individuals that, if disclosed, would violate the right of privacy or publicity of the\\nindividuals to whom the information relates; or investigative reports.\\n227.7206 Contracts for architect-engineer services.\\nFollow 227.7107 when contracting for architect-engineer services.\\n227.7207 Contractor data repositories.\\nFollow 227.7108 when it is in the Government\\'s interests to have a data repository include computer software or to have a\\nseparate computer software repository.

The FAA’s repair\\nstation search tool is available at https://av-info.faa.gov/repairstation.asp. All aircraft flying public aircraft operations operate\\nunder airworthiness certificates maintained by the military services. The FAA airworthiness certificate in the exception in this\\nparagraph (d) underlies the military service certificate.\\n(e) Insurance. The clause at 252.228-7001, Ground and Flight Risk, is intended to reduce acquisition costs by eliminating\\nthe costs of commercial insurance premiums. This clause also is intended to encourage the contractor to perform safe and\\neffective operations through inclusion of a contractor’s share of loss (i.e., a deductible). Additionally, the clause requires\\ncompliance with the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor’s Flight and Ground Operations” (Air Force\\nInstruction 10-220, Army Regulation 95-20, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Instruction 3710.1 (Series), Coast\\nGuard Instruction M13020.3 (Series), and Defense Contract Management Agency Instruction 8210-1 (Series)), which\\nprovides procedures to mitigate the risk of loss to the Government. For this reason, paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of the clause at\\n252.228-7001 specifies that insurance premium costs are unallowable. In addition, paragraph (d)(4) of the clause provides\\nthat the Government’s assumption of risk does not apply where the loss or damage is covered by available insurance.\\n(f) Damage to Government aircraft.\\n(1) Whenever damage to Government aircraft is reported, each incident should be evaluated on its own merits. When\\nthe cost of repair exceeds the contractor’s share of loss provisions, the contracting officer shall make a liability determination\\nin accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.\\n(2) Contracting officers should consult with the requiring activity and the assigned contract administration office on\\nreplacement, repair, or beyond economic repair decisions.\\n(3) See PGI 228.370-2(f) for an example of accident or mishap damage versus workmanship-error damage.\\n(g) Contracting officer determination of liability.\\n(1) When making a liability determination, the contracting officer should seek input from the GFR and legal counsel, as\\nneeded.\\n(2) The Government’s assumption of risk shall not extend to damage, loss, or destruction of covered aircraft that—\\n(i) Is the result of willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the contractor’s managerial personnel,\\nincluding the contractor’s oversight of subcontractors;\\n(ii) Is sustained during flight if either the flight or the crew members have not been approved in advance and in\\nwriting by the GFR, who has been authorized in accordance with the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor’s\\nFlight and Ground Operations”;\\n(iii) Occurs in the course of transportation by rail, or by conveyance on public streets, highways, or waterways,\\nunless the transportation is limited to the vicinity of the contractor’s premises, and incidental to work performed under the\\ncontract as described in the Schedule;\\n(iv) Is covered by insurance;\\n(v) Occurs after the contracting officer has, in writing, revoked the Government’s assumption of risk; or\\n(vi) Is sustained due to workmanship errors.\\n(h) Notice of revocation of the Government’s assumption of risk. The liability provisions of the clause at FAR 52.245-1,\\nGovernment Property, do not apply to the aircraft impacted by a notice of revocation.\\n(1) Preliminary notice of revocation.\\n(i) When finding that contractor managerial personnel have failed to comply with the combined regulation/\\ninstruction, as required by paragraph (b) of the clause at 252.228-7001, including finding the covered aircraft are exposed\\nto unreasonable conditions, the contracting officer shall issue a preliminary notice of revocation of the Government’s\\nassumption of risk to the contractor and shall require the contractor to comply with contract requirements. Factors for\\nthe contracting officer to consider in determining exposure to unreasonable conditions include, but are not limited to, the\\nfollowing:\\n228.3-3\\n\\n228.370-2\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(A) Lack of adequate hangar fire suppression or firefighting vehicles;\\n(B) Failure to provide adequate procedures to the GFR; or\\n(C) Systemic failure to comply with approved procedures.\\n(ii) The preliminary notice of revocation will state the timeframe for the contractor to correct the noncompliance or\\nconditions.\\n(2) Notice of revocation. If the contractor fails to correct the cited noncompliance or conditions within the specified\\ntimeframe, the contracting officer shall issue to the contractor a notice of revocation of the Government’s assumption of risk\\nfor any covered aircraft.\\n(i) Thereafter the contractor assumes the entire risk for damage, loss, or destruction of the previously covered\\naircraft.\\n(ii) Any costs incurred by the contractor, including the costs of the contractor’s self-insurance, insurance premiums\\npaid to insure the contractor’s assumption of risk, deductibles associated with such purchased insurance, etc., to mitigate its\\nrisk are unallowable costs.\\n(iii) The notice of revocation does not relieve the contractor of its obligation to comply with all other provisions\\nof the clause at 252.228-7001, including the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor’s Flight and Ground\\nOperations.”\\n(iv) Within 3 days of receipt of the contractor’s notice of correction, the contracting officer shall notify the\\ncontractor whether the Government will resume risk of loss. The contracting officer shall determine that the noncompliance\\nor cited conditions have been corrected prior to resuming assumption of risk.\\n(v) Any disputes regarding the contracting officer’s notice of revocation shall be subject to FAR clause 52.233-1,\\nDisputes.\\n(i) Procedures in the event of damage, loss, or destruction of covered aircraft.\\n(1) In the event of damage, loss, or destruction of covered aircraft, except in cases covered by paragraph (j)(2) of this\\nsection, the contracting officer shall evaluate the contractor’s statement of—\\n(i) The damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft;\\n(ii) The time and origin of the damage, loss, or destruction;\\n(iii) All known interests in commingled property of which aircraft are a part; and\\n(iv) The insurance, if any, covering the interest in commingled property.\\n(2) If a new production aircraft is damaged, lost, or destroyed before it has become a covered aircraft, the Government\\nbears no responsibility for risk of loss.\\n(3) If a new production aircraft is damaged, lost, or destroyed after it has become a covered aircraft, the contracting\\nofficer shall provide written direction to the contractor to take action in accordance with the contracting officer’s written\\ndirection that the aircraft shall be—\\n(i) Replaced;\\n(ii) Repaired to the condition immediately prior to the damage; or\\n(iii) Considered beyond economic repair. The contracting officer shall decide whether further actions are required\\nunder the contract.\\n(4) If a covered aircraft that has been furnished by the Government to the contractor is damaged, lost, or destroyed\\nwhile covered, the contracting officer shall provide written direction to the contractor that the aircraft shall be—\\n(i) Repaired; or\\n(ii) Considered beyond economic repair. The contracting officer shall decide further actions required under the\\ncontract.\\n(5) The contracting officer shall make an equitable adjustment for expenditures made in performing the obligations\\nunder paragraph (h) of the clause at 252.228-7001.\\n(j) Contracting officer determination of the contractor’s share of loss.\\n(1) The contractor’s share of loss or damage to covered aircraft, except for loss or damage caused by negligence of\\nGovernment personnel, is the least of—\\n(i) $200,000;\\n(ii) 20 percent of the price or estimated acquisition cost of affected aircraft; or\\n(iii) 20 percent of the price or estimated cost of the contract, task order, or delivery order.\\n(2) If the Government requires covered aircraft to be replaced or repaired by the contractor, any resulting equitable\\nadjustment shall not include reimbursement of the contractor’s share of loss.\\n228.3-4\\n\\nSUBPART 228.3 - INSURANCE\\n228.371\\n(3) In the event the Government does not decide to replace or repair the covered aircraft, the clause at 252.228-7001\\nrequires the contractor to credit the contract price or pay the Government, as directed by the contracting officer, the least of—\\n(i) $200,000;\\n(ii) 20 percent of the price or estimated acquisition cost of affected aircraft; or\\n(iii) 20 percent of the price or estimated cost of the contract, task order, or delivery order.\\n(4) The costs incurred by the contractor for its share of the loss and for insuring against that loss are unallowable costs,\\nincluding but not limited to—\\n(i) The contractor’s share of loss under the Government’s self-insurance;\\n(ii) The costs of the contractor’s self-insurance;\\n(iii) The deductible for any contractor-purchased insurance;\\n(iv) Insurance premiums paid for contractor-purchased insurance; and\\n(v) Costs associated with determining, litigating, and defending against the contractor’s liability.\\n(k) Reimbursement from a third party. If the contracting officer finds or has reason to believe that the contractor has been\\nreimbursed or otherwise compensated by a third party for damage, loss, or destruction of covered aircraft and has also been\\ncompensated by the Government, then the contracting officer shall demand an equitable reimbursement. If the contracting\\nofficer requests that the contractor provide reasonable assistance in obtaining recovery, such effort shall be an allowable\\nexpense of the contractor.\\n228.370-3 Aircraft not owned by or to be delivered to the Government.\\n(a) When a contract involves aircraft not owned by or to be delivered to the Government, the contracting officer may use\\nthe clause at 252.228-7001 only if the contracting officer determines that it is in the best interest of the Government.\\n(b) Potential factors for the contracting officer to consider when deciding which course of action is in the best interest of\\nthe Government include, but are not limited to, whether—\\n(1) The cost of hull insurance exceeds the replacement cost of the aircraft;\\n(2) Insurance is not available (e.g., high-risk experimental flights and operations of aircraft in a war zone); or\\n(3) Ground or flight activities that involve contractor-owned and contractor-operated aircraft may pose risk to\\nGovernment aircraft (e.g., due to close proximity in flight).\\n228.371 Additional clauses.\\n(a) Use the clause at 252.228-7000 , Reimbursement for War-Hazard Losses, when—\\n(1) The clause at FAR 52.228-4, Worker\\'s Compensation and War-Hazard Insurance Overseas, is used; and\\n(2) The head of the contracting activity decides not to allow the contractor to buy insurance for war-hazard losses.\\n(b) Use the clause at 252.228-7001 , Ground and Flight Risk, in solicitations and contracts–\\n(1) For the acquisition, development, production, modification, maintenance, repair, flight, or overhaul of aircraft\\nowned by or to be delivered to the Government, except those solicitations and contracts\\n(i) That are strictly for activities incidental to the normal operations of the aircraft (e.g., refueling operations, minor\\nnon-structural actions not requiring towing such as replacing aircraft tires due to wear and tear);\\n(ii) That are awarded for purchase under FAR part 12 procedures;\\n(iii) For which a non-DoD customer (including an FMS customer per 225.7305) has decided to allow the use of\\ncommercial insurance or other self-insurance; has not agreed to assume the risk for loss or destruction of, or damages to, the\\naircraft; or\\n(iv) For commercial derivative aircraft with an FAA certificate of airworthiness maintained to FAA standards. when\\nthe work will be performed at a licensed FAA repair station.

The term also includes a subcontract for an amount exceeding the simplified\\nacquisition threshold, except for a fixed-price subcontract without cost incentives under such a prime contract.\\n“Covered segment” means a product division of the contractor that allocated more than $1,100,000 in independent\\nresearch and development (IR&D) costs and bid and proposal (B&P) costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal\\nyear. In the case of a contractor that has no product divisions, the term means that contractor as a whole. A product division\\nof the contractor that allocated less than $1,100,000 in IR&D costs and B&P costs to covered contracts during the preceding\\nfiscal year is not subject to the limitations in paragraph (c) of this section.\\n“Major contractor” means any contractor whose covered segments allocated a total of more than $11 million in IR&D\\ncosts and B&P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year. For purposes of calculating the dollar threshold\\namounts to determine whether a contractor meets the definition of “major contractor,” do not include contractor segments\\nallocating less than $1,100,000 of IR&D and B&P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year.\\n(c) Allowability.\\n(i) Departments/agencies shall not supplement this regulation in any way that limits IR&D cost allowability and\\nB&P cost allowability.\\n(ii) See 225.7303-2 (c) for allowability provisions affecting foreign military sale contracts.\\n(iii)(A) For IR&D costs major contractors incurred on covered contracts to be allowable—\\n(1) The contractor is required to report IR&D projects generating the IR&D costs to the\\nDefense Technical Information Center (DTIC) using the DTIC’s online input form and instructions at  https://\\ndefenseinnovationmarketplace.dtic.mil/industry-portal/ ;and\\n(2) The contractor is required to update its DTIC inputs at least annually, no later than 3 months after the\\nend of the contractor’s fiscal year, and when the project is completed.\\n(B) The amount of IR&D costs allowable under DoD contracts shall not exceed the lesser of—\\n(1) Such contracts’ allocable share of total incurred IR&D costs; or\\n(2) The total amount of incurred IR&D costs that the chief executive officer of the contractor has\\ndetermined will advance the needs of DoD for future technology and advanced capability as DoD describes such needs in\\ncommunications referenced at 242.771-3(c)(1)(i).\\n(C) Contractors that are not major contractors are encouraged to use the DTIC online input form and instructions\\nat  https://defenseinnovationmarketplace.dtic.mil/industry-portal/ to report IR&D projects in order to provide DoD with\\nvisibility into the technical content of the contractors’ IR&D projects.\\n(iv) Contractors are required to report incurred IR&D costs separately from indirect costs.\\n(v) Contractors are required to report incurred B&P costs separately from other indirect costs.\\n231.2-1\\n\\n231.205-19\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n231.205-19 Insurance and indemnification.\\n(e) In addition to the cost limitations in FAR 31.205-19(e), self-insurance and purchased insurance costs are subject to the\\nrequirements of the clauses at 252.217-7012 , Liability and Insurance, and 252.228-7001 , Ground and Flight Risk.\\n231.205-22 Lobbying and political activity costs.\\n(a) Costs associated with preparing any material, report, list, or analysis on the actual or projected economic or\\nemployment impact in a particular State or congressional district of an acquisition program for which all research,\\ndevelopment, testing, and evaluation has not been completed also are unallowable (10 U.S.C. 4652).\\n231.205-70 External restructuring costs.\\n(a) Scope. This subsection—\\n(1) Prescribes policies and procedures for allowing contractor external restructuring costs when savings would result\\nfor DoD; and\\n(2) Implements 10 U.S.C. 3761.\\n(b) Definitions. As used in this subsection:\\n(1) “Business combination” means a transaction whereby assets or operations of two or more companies not previously\\nunder common ownership or control are combined, whether by merger, acquisition, or sale/purchase of assets.\\n(2) “External restructuring activities” means restructuring activities occurring after a business combination that affect\\nthe operations of companies not previously under common ownership or control. They do not include restructuring activities\\noccurring after a business combination that affect the operations of only one of the companies not previously under common\\nownership or control, or, when there has been no business combination, restructuring activities undertaken within one\\ncompany. External restructuring activities are a direct outgrowth of a business combination. They normally will be initiated\\nwithin 3 years of the business combination.\\n(3) “Restructuring activities” means nonroutine, nonrecurring, or extraordinary activities to combine facilities,\\noperations, or workforce, in order to eliminate redundant capabilities, improve future operations, and reduce overall costs.\\nRestructuring activities do not include routine or ongoing repositionings and redeployments of a contractor’s productive\\nfacilities or workforce (e.g., normal plant rearrangement or employee relocation), nor do they include other routine or\\nordinary activities charged as indirect costs that would otherwise have been incurred (e.g., planning and analysis, contract\\nadministration and oversight, or recurring financial and administrative support).\\n(4) “Restructuring costs” means the costs, including both direct and indirect, of restructuring activities. Restructuring\\ncosts that may be allowed include, but are not limited to, severance pay for employees, early retirement incentive payments\\nfor employees, employee retraining costs, relocation expense for retained employees, and relocation and rearrangement of\\nplant and equipment. For purposes of this definition, if restructuring costs associated with external restructuring activities\\nallocated to DoD contracts are less than $2.5 million, the costs shall not be subject to the audit, review, and determination\\nrequirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this subsection; instead, the normal rules for determining cost allowability in accordance\\nwith FAR Part 31 shall apply.\\n(5) “Restructuring savings” means cost reductions, including both direct and indirect cost reductions, that result from\\nrestructuring activities. Reassignments of cost to future periods are not restructuring savings.\\n(c) Limitations on cost allowability. Restructuring costs associated with external restructuring activities shall not be\\nallowed unless—\\n(1) Such costs are allowable in accordance with FAR Part 31 and DFARS Part 231;\\n(2) An audit of projected restructuring costs and restructuring savings is performed;\\n(3) The cognizant administrative contracting officer (ACO) reviews the audit report and the projected costs and\\nprojected savings, and negotiates an advance agreement in accordance with paragraph (d) of this subsection; and\\n(4)(i) The official designated in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this subsection determines in writing that the audited projected\\nsavings, on a present value basis, for DoD resulting from the restructuring will exceed either—\\n(A) The costs allowed by a factor of at least two to one; or\\n(B) The costs allowed, and the business combination will result in the preservation of a critical capability that\\nmight otherwise be lost to DoD.\\n(ii)(A) If the amount of restructuring costs is expected to exceed $25 million over a 5-year period, the designated\\nofficial is the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment) or the Principal Deputy. This authority may not be\\ndelegated below the level of an Assistant Secretary of Defense.\\n231.2-2\\n\\nSUBPART 231.2 - CONTRACTS WITH COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATIONS\\n231.205-71\\n(B) For all other cases, the designated official is the Director of the Defense Contract Management Agency. The\\nDirector may not delegate this authority.\\n(d) Procedures and ACO responsibilities.As soon as it is known that the contractor will incur restructuring costs for\\nexternal restructuring activities, the cognizant ACO shall follow the procedures at PGI 231.205-70 (d).\\n(e) Information needed to obtain a determination.\\n(1) The novation agreement (if one is required).\\n(2) The contractor’s restructuring proposal.\\n(3) The proposed advance agreement.\\n(4) The audit report.\\n(5) Any other pertinent information.\\n(6) The cognizant ACO’s recommendation for a determination. This recommendation must clearly indicate one of the\\nfollowing, consistent with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this subsection:\\n(i) The audited projected savings for DoD will exceed the costs allowed by a factor of at least two to one on a\\npresent value basis.\\n(ii) The business combination will result in the preservation of a critical capability that might otherwise be lost to\\nDoD, and the audited projected savings for DoD will exceed the costs allowed on a present value basis.\\n(f) Contracting officer responsibilities.\\n(1) The contracting officer, in consultation with the cognizant ACO, should consider including a repricing clause in\\nnoncompetitive fixed-price contracts that are negotiated during the period between—\\n(i) The time a business combination is announced; and\\n(ii) The time the contractor’s forward pricing rates are adjusted to reflect the impact of restructuring.\\n(2) The decision to use a repricing clause will depend upon the particular circumstances involved, including—\\n(i) When the restructuring will take place;\\n(ii) When restructuring savings will begin to be realized;\\n(iii) The contract performance period;\\n(iv) Whether the contracting parties are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of restructuring on the\\ncontract; and\\n(v) The size of the potential dollar impact of restructuring on the contract.\\n(3) If the contracting officer decides to use a repricing clause, the clause must provide for a downward-only price\\nadjustment to ensure that DoD receives its appropriate share of restructuring net savings.\\n231.205-71 Costs related to counterfeit electronic parts and suspect counterfeit electronic parts.\\n(a) Scope.

Generally, the contracting officer shall\\ninsert the standard due dates of 7 days for progress payments, and 14 days for performance-based payments and interim\\npayments on cost-type contracts, in the appropriate paragraphs of the respective payment clauses. For interim payments on\\ncost-reimbursement contracts for services, see 232.906 (a)(i).\\n(b) The contracting officer should coordinate contract financing payment terms with offices that will be involved in the\\npayment process to ensure that specified terms can be met. Where justified, the contracting officer may insert a due date\\ngreater than, but not less than, the standard.

In addition, the contracting officer shall consider\\nperforming a financial review—\\n(a) Prior to award of a contract, when—\\n(1) The contractor is on a list requiring preaward clearance or other special clearance before award;\\n(2) The contractor is listed on the Consolidated List of Contractors Indebted to the Government (Hold-Up List), or is\\notherwise known to be indebted to the Government;\\n(3) The contractor may receive Government assets such as contract financing payments or Government property;\\n(4) The contractor is experiencing performance difficulties on other work; or\\n(5) The contractor is a new company or a new supplier of the item.\\n(b) At periodic intervals after award of a contract, when—\\n(1) Any of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5) of this subsection are applicable; or\\n(2) There is any other reason to question the contractor’s ability to finance performance and completion of the contract.\\n232.072-2 Appropriate information.\\n(a) The contracting officer shall obtain the type and depth of financial and other information that is required to establish\\na contractor’s financial capability or disclose a contractor’s financial condition. While the contracting officer should not\\nrequest information that is not necessary for protection of the Government’s interests, the contracting officer must insist upon\\nobtaining the information that is necessary. The unwillingness or inability of a contractor to present reasonably requested\\ninformation in a timely manner, especially information that a prudent business person would be expected to have and to use\\nin the professional management of a business, may be a material fact in the determination of the contractor’s responsibility\\nand prospects for contract completion.\\n(b) The contracting officer shall obtain the following information to the extent required to protect the Government’s\\ninterest. In addition, if the contracting officer concludes that information not listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(10) of\\nthis subsection is required to comply with 232.072-1 , that information should be requested. The information must be for the\\nperson(s) who are legally liable for contract performance. If the contractor is not a corporation, the contracting officer shall\\nobtain the required information for each individual/joint venturer/partner:\\n(1) Balance sheet and income statement—\\n(i) For the current fiscal year (interim);\\n(ii) For the most recent fiscal year and, preferably, for the 2 preceding fiscal years. These should be certified by an\\nindependent public accountant or by an appropriate officer of the firm; and\\n(iii) Forecasted for each fiscal year for the remainder of the period of contract performance.\\n(2) Summary history of the contractor and its principal managers, disclosing any previous insolvencies—corporate or\\npersonal, and describing its products or services.\\n(3) Statement of all affiliations disclosing—\\n(i) Material financial interests of the contractor;\\n(ii) Material financial interests in the contractor;\\n(iii) Material affiliations of owners, officers, directors, major stockholders; and\\n(iv) The major stockholders if the contractor is not a widely-traded, publicly-held corporation.\\n(4) Statement of all forms of compensation to each officer, manager, partner, joint venturer, or proprietor, as appropriate\\n—\\n(i) Planned for the current year;\\n(ii) Paid during the past 2 years; and\\n(iii) Deferred to future periods.\\n(5) Business base and forecast that—\\n(i) Shows, by significant markets, existing contracts and outstanding offers, including those under negotiation; and\\n(ii) Is reconcilable to indirect cost rate projections.\\n(6) Cash forecast for the duration of the contract (see 232.072-3 ).\\n(7) Financing arrangement information that discloses—\\n(i) Availability of cash to finance contract performance;\\n(ii) Contractor’s exposure to financial crisis from creditor’s demands;\\n(iii) Degree to which credit security provisions could conflict with Government title terms under contract financing;\\n-2\\n\\n232.072 FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF CONTRACTORS.\\n232.072-3\\n(iv) Clearly stated confirmations of credit with no unacceptable qualifications; and\\n(v) Unambiguous written agreement by a creditor if credit arrangements include deferred trade payments or creditor\\nsubordinations/repayment suspensions.\\n(8) Statement of all state, local, and Federal tax accounts, including special mandatory contributions, e.g.,\\nenvironmental superfund.\\n(9) Description and explanation of the financial effect of issues such as—\\n(i) Leases, deferred purchase arrangements, or patent or royalty arrangements;\\n(ii) Insurance, when relevant to the contract;\\n(iii) Contemplated capital expenditures, changes in equity, or contractor debt load;\\n(iv) Pending claims either by or against the contractor;\\n(v) Contingent liabilities such as guarantees, litigation, environmental, or product liabilities;\\n(vi) Validity of accounts receivable and actual value of inventory, as assets; and\\n(vii) Status and aging of accounts payable.\\n(10) Significant ratios such as—\\n(i) Inventory to annual sales;\\n(ii) Inventory to current assets;\\n(iii) Liquid assets to current assets;\\n(iv) Liquid assets to current liabilities;\\n(v) Current assets to current liabilities; and\\n(vi) Net worth to net debt.\\n232.072-3 Cash flow forecasts.\\n(a) A contractor must be able to sustain a sufficient cash flow to perform the contract. When there is doubt regarding the\\nsufficiency of a contractor’s cash flow, the contracting officer should require the contractor to submit a cash flow forecast\\ncovering the duration of the contract.\\n(b) A contractor’s inability or refusal to prepare and provide cash flow forecasts or to reconcile actual cash flow with\\nprevious forecasts is a strong indicator of serious managerial deficiencies or potential contract cost or performance problems.\\n(c) Single or one-time cash flow forecasts are of limited forecasting power. As such, they should be limited to preaward\\nsurvey situations. Reliability of cash flow forecasts can be established only by comparing a series of previous actual cash\\nflows with the corresponding forecasts and examining the causes of any differences.\\n(d) Cash flow forecasts must—\\n(1) Show the origin and use of all material amounts of cash within the entire business unit responsible for contract\\nperformance, period by period, for the length of the contract (or until the risk of a cash crisis ends); and\\n(2) Provide an audit trail to the data and assumptions used to prepare it.\\n(e) Cash flow forecasts can be no more reliable than the assumptions on which they are based. Most important of these\\nassumptions are—\\n(1) Estimated amounts and timing of purchases and payments for materials, parts, components, subassemblies, and\\nservices;\\n(2) Estimated amounts and timing of payments for purchase or production of capital assets, test facilities, and tooling;\\n(3) Amounts and timing of fixed cash charges such as debt installments, interest, rentals, taxes, and indirect costs;\\n(4) Estimated amounts and timing of payments for projected labor, both direct and indirect;\\n(5) Reasonableness of projected manufacturing and production schedules;\\n(6) Estimated amounts and timing of billings to customers (including progress payments), and customer payments;\\n(7) Estimated amounts and timing of cash receipts from lenders or other credit sources, and liquidation of loans; and\\n(8) Estimated amounts and timing of cash receipts from other sources.\\n(f) The contracting officer should review the assumptions underlying the cash flow forecasts. In determining whether the\\nassumptions are reasonable and realistic, the contracting officer should consult with—\\n(1) The contractor;\\n(2) Government personnel in the areas of finance, engineering, production, cost, and price analysis; or\\n(3) Prospective supply, subcontract, and loan or credit sources.\\n-3\\n\\n232.102\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\nSubpart 232.1 - FINANCING FOR OTHER THAN A COMMERCIAL PURCHASE\\n232.102 Description of contract financing methods.\\n(e)(2) Progress payments based on percentage or stage of completion are authorized only for contracts for construction (as\\ndefined in FAR 36.102), shipbuilding, and ship conversion, alteration, or repair. However, percentage or stage of completion\\nmethods of measuring contractor performance may be used for performance-based payments in accordance with FAR Subpart\\n32.10.\\n232.102-70 Provisional delivery payments.\\n(a) The contracting officer may establish provisional delivery payments to pay contractors for the costs of supplies and\\nservices delivered to and accepted by the Government under the following contract actions, if undefinitized:\\n(1) Letter contracts contemplating a fixed-price contract.\\n(2) Orders under basic ordering agreements.\\n(3) Spares provisioning documents annexed to contracts.\\n(4) Unpriced equitable adjustments on fixed-price contracts.\\n(5) Orders under indefinite-delivery contracts.\\n(b) Provisional delivery payments shall be—\\n(1) Used sparingly;\\n(2) Priced conservatively; and\\n(3) Reduced by liquidating previous progress payments in accordance with the Progress Payments clause.\\n(c) Provisional delivery payments shall not—\\n(1) Include profit;\\n(2) Exceed funds obligated for the undefinitized contract action; or\\n(3) Influence the definitized contract price.\\n232.104 Providing contract financing.\\nFor fixed-price contracts with a period of performance in excess of a year that meet the dollar thresholds established in\\nFAR 32.104(d), and for solicitations expected to result in such contracts, in lieu of the requirement at FAR 32.104(d)(1)(ii)\\nfor the contractor to demonstrate actual financial need or the unavailability of private financing, DoD has determined that—\\n(1) The use of customary contract financing (see FAR 32.113), other than loan guarantees and advance payments, is in\\nDoD’s best interest; and\\n(2) Further justification of its use in individual acquisitions is unnecessary.\\n232.1-4\\n\\nSUBPART 232.2 - COMMERCIAL PRODUCT AND COMMERCIAL SERVICE PURCHASE FINANCING\\n232.206\\nSubpart 232.2 - COMMERCIAL PRODUCT AND\\nCOMMERCIAL SERVICE PURCHASE FINANCING\\n232.202 RESERVED\\n232.202-4 Security for Government financing.\\n(a)(2) When determining whether an offeror’s financial condition is adequate security, see 232.072-2 and 232.072-3 for\\nguidance. It should be noted that an offeror’s financial condition may be sufficient to make the contractor responsible for\\naward purposes, but may not be adequate security for commercial contract financing.\\n232.206 Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.\\n(f) Prompt payment for commercial purchase payments. The contracting officer shall incorporate the following standard\\nprompt payment terms for commercial product and commercial service contract financing:\\n(i) Commercial advance payments: The contractor entitlement date specified in the contract, or 30 days after receipt\\nby the designated billing office of a proper request for payment, whichever is later.\\n(ii) Commercial interim payments: The contractor entitlement date specified in the contract, or 14 days after\\nreceipt by the designated billing office of a proper request for payment, whichever is later. The prompt payment standards\\nfor commercial delivery payments shall be the same as specified in FAR Subpart 32.9 for invoice payments for the item\\ndelivered.\\n(g) Installment payment financing for commercial products and commercial services. Installment payment financing shall\\nnot be used for DoD contracts, unless market research has established that this form of contract financing is both appropriate\\nand customary in the commercial marketplace. When installment payment financing is used, the contracting officer shall\\nuse the ceiling percentage of contract price that is customary in the particular marketplace (not to exceed the maximum rate\\nestablished in FAR 52.232-30).\\n232.2-1\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n232.2-2\\n\\nSUBPART 232.3 - LOAN GUARANTEES FOR DEFENSE PRODUCTION\\n232.302\\nSubpart 232.3 - LOAN GUARANTEES FOR DEFENSE PRODUCTION\\n232.302 Authority.\\n(a) The use of guaranteed loans as a contract financing mechanism requires the availability of certain congressional\\nauthority.

See PGI 232.1001 (a) for additional information on use of\\nperformance-based payments. However, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3802(a)(2), performance-based payments shall not\\nbe conditioned upon costs incurred in contract performance, but on the achievement of performance outcomes. Subject to\\nthe criteria in 232.1003-70 , all companies, including nontraditional defense contractors, are eligible for performance-based\\npayments, consistent with best commercial practices.\\n(d) The contracting officer shall use the following standard payment terms for performance-based payments: The\\ncontractor entitlement date, if any, specified in the contract, or 14 days after receipt by the designated billing office of a\\nproper request for payment, whichever is later.\\n232.1003 Reserved.\\n232.1003-70 Criteria for use.\\nIn accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3802(c)(1), a contractor’s financial statements shall be in compliance with Generally\\nAccepted Accounting Principles, in order to receive performance-based payments. 10 U.S.C. 3802(c)(2) specifies that it\\ndoes not grant the Defense Contract Audit Agency the authority to audit compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting\\nPrinciples.\\n232.1004 Procedures.\\n(b) Establishing performance-based finance payment amounts.\\n(i) The contracting officer should include in a solicitation both the progress payments and performance-based\\npayments provisions and clauses prescribed in this part, when considering both types of payment methods.

The PBP\\nanalysis tool and Performance Based Payment - Guidebook are available at https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/pcf/pricing-\\ntopics.html#pdp .\\n(A) When considering performance-based payments, obtain from the offeror/contractor a proposed performance-\\nbased payments schedule that includes all performance-based payments events, completion criteria and event values along\\nwith the projected monthly expenditure profile in order to negotiate the value of the performance events such that the\\nperformance-based payments are not expected to result in an unreasonably low or negative level of contractor investment in\\nthe contract.\\nIf performance-based payments are deemed practical, the Government will evaluate and negotiate the details of the\\nperformance-based payments schedule.\\n(B) For modifications to contracts that already use performance-based payments financing, the basis for\\nnegotiation must include performance-based payments. The PBP analysis tool will be used in the same manner to help\\ndetermine the price for the modification;\\n(iii) The contracting officer shall document in the contract file that the performance-based payment schedule\\nprovides a mutually beneficial settlement position that reflects adequate consideration to the Government for the improved\\ncontractor cash flow.\\n(c) Instructions for multiple appropriations. If the contract contains foreign military sales requirements, the contracting\\nofficer shall provide instructions for distribution of the contract financing payments to each country’s account.\\n232.1005 Reserved.\\n232.1005-70 Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.\\n(a) The contracting officer shall include the following clauses with appropriate fill-ins in solicitations and contracts that\\ninclude performance-based payments:\\n232.10-1\\n\\n232.1005-70\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(1) For performance-based payments made on a whole-contract basis, use the clause at 252.232-7012 , Performance-\\nBased Payments–Whole-Contract Basis.\\n(2) For performance-based payments made on a deliverable-item basis, use the clause at 252.232-7013 , Performance-\\nBased Payments–Deliverable-Item Basis.\\n(b) Use the provision at 252.232-7015 , Performance-Based Payments–Representation, in solicitations where the resulting\\ncontract may include performance-based payments.\\n(c) Use the provision at 252.232-7016 , Notice of Progress Payments or Performance-Based Payments, in lieu of FAR\\n52.232-13, Notice of Progress Payments, when the solicitation contains clauses for progress payments and performance-\\nbased payments (only one type of financing will be included in the resultant contract, except as may be authorized on\\nseparate orders subject to FAR 32.1003(c)).\\n232.10-2\\n\\nSUBPART 232.11 - ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER\\n232.1110\\nSubpart 232.11 - ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER\\n232.1108 Payment by Governmentwide commercial purchase card.\\n232.1108-70 Prohibition of Governmentwide commercial purchase card as a method of payment when the tax on\\ncertain foreign procurements applies.\\nThe contracting officer shall not authorize the Governmentwide commercial purchase card as a method of payment\\nduring any contract period of performance if the contract includes the clause at FAR 52.229-12, Tax on Certain Foreign\\nProcurements, unless the contract also includes the clause at 252.229-7014, Full Exemption from Two-Percent Excise Tax on\\nCertain Foreign Procurements, indicating that the contractor is fully exempt from the tax.\\n232.1110 Solicitation provision and contract clauses.\\nUse the clause at 252.232-7009 , Mandatory Payment by Governmentwide Commercial Purchase Card, in solicitations,\\ncontracts, and agreements, including solicitations, contracts, and agreements using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition\\nof commercial products and commercial services, when—\\n(1) Placement of orders or calls valued at or below the micro-purchase threshold is anticipated;

For example, as a condition of a foreign military\\nsale, the contractor may require or agree to permit the customer to produce in its country certain components or subsystems\\nof the item being sold. Generally, direct offsets must be performed within a specified period, because they are integral to the\\ndeliverable of the FMS contract.\\n(2) An indirect offset involves benefits or obligations, including supplies or services that are not directly related to the\\nspecific item(s) being purchased and are not integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract. For example, as a condition of\\na foreign military sale, the contractor may agree to purchase certain manufactured products, agricultural commodities, raw\\nmaterials, or services, or make an equity investment or grant of equipment required by the FMS customer, or may agree to\\nbuild a school, road or other facility.

When issues within the proper scope of the appeal, but not raised by the pleadings, are tried\\nby express or implied consent of the parties, or by permission of the Board, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had\\nbeen raised therein. In such instances, motions to amend the pleadings to conform to the proof may be entered, but are not\\nrequired. If evidence is objected to at a hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues raised by the pleadings, it may be\\nadmitted within the proper scope of the appeal, provided however, that the objecting party may be granted an opportunity to\\nmeet such evidence.\\nRule 7. Motions\\n(a) Motions Generally—The Board may entertain and rule upon motions and may defer ruling as appropriate. The Board\\nwill rule on motions so as to secure, to the fullest extent practicable, the informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of\\n1-4\\n\\nPART 1 —CHARTER\\nappeals. All motions should be filed as separate documents with an appropriate heading describing the motion. Oral argument\\non motions is subject to the discretion of the Board.\\n(b) Jurisdictional Motions—Any motion addressed to the jurisdiction of the Board should be promptly filed. An\\nevidentiary hearing to address disputed jurisdictional facts will be afforded on application of either party or by order of the\\nBoard. The Board may defer its decision on the motion pending hearing on the merits. The Board may at any time and on its\\nown initiative raise the issue of its jurisdiction, and shall do so by an appropriate order, affording the parties an opportunity to\\nbe heard thereon.\\n(c) Summary Judgment Motions—\\n(1) To facilitate disposition of such a motion, the parties should adhere to the following procedures. Where the parties\\nagree that disposition by summary judgment or partial summary judgment is appropriate, they may file a stipulation of\\nall material facts necessary for the Board to rule on the motion. Otherwise, the moving party should file with its motion\\na “Statement of Undisputed Material Facts,” setting forth the claimed undisputed material facts in separate, numbered\\nparagraphs. The non-moving party should file a “Statement of Genuine Issues of Material Fact,” responding to each\\nnumbered paragraph proposed, demonstrating, where appropriate, the existence of material facts in dispute and if appropriate\\npropose additional facts. The moving party and the non-moving party should submit a memorandum of law supporting or\\nopposing summary judgment.\\n(2) In deciding motions for summary judgment, the Board looks to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\\nfor guidance. The parties should explicitly state and support by specific evidence all facts and legal arguments necessary to\\nsustain a party’s position. Each party should cite to the record and attach any additional evidence upon which it relies (e.g.,\\naffidavits, declarations, excerpts from depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions). The Board may accept a fact\\nproperly proposed and supported by one party as undisputed, unless the opposing party properly responds and establishes that\\nit is in dispute.\\n(d) Response to Motions—A non-moving party has 30 days from receipt of a motion to file its response, unless a different\\nperiod is ordered by the Board. A moving party has 30 days from receipt of a non-moving party’s response to file a reply,\\nunless a different period is ordered by the Board.\\nRule 8.

Absent stipulation or a Board order, no\\ndiscovery may be served prior to this conference. Any motion pertaining to a discovery dispute shall include a statement that\\nthe movant has in good faith attempted to resolve the discovery dispute without involvement of the Board. In connection with\\nany discovery procedure, the Board may issue orders to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, or undue\\nburden or expense. Those orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time, and place for discovery, and provisions\\nfor governing the disclosure of information or documents. Any discovery under this Rule shall be subject to the provisions of\\nRule 16 with respect to sanctions.\\n(b) Depositions—When Permitted—Subject to paragraph (a) of this Rule, a party may take, or the Board may upon motion\\norder the taking of, testimony of any person by deposition upon oral examination or written interrogatories before any officer\\nauthorized to administer oaths at the place of examination, for use as evidence or for purpose of discovery. The Board expects\\nthe parties to make persons under their control available for deposition. The motion for an order shall specify whether the\\npurpose of the deposition is discovery or for use as evidence.\\n(1) Depositions—Orders—The time, place, and manner of taking depositions shall be as mutually agreed by the parties,\\nor failing such agreement, governed by order of the Board.\\n(2) Depositions—Use as Evidence—No testimony taken by deposition shall be considered as part of the evidence\\nin the hearing of an appeal until such testimony is offered and received in evidence at such hearing. It will not ordinarily\\nbe received in evidence if the deponent can testify at the hearing. The deposition may be used to contradict or impeach\\nthe testimony of the deponent given at a hearing.

Where circumstances\\nrequire, the Board may act upon such a request at any time after a copy of the request has been served upon the opposing\\nparty.\\n(e) Form of Subpoena—\\n(1) Every subpoena shall state the name of the Board and the caption of the appeal, and shall command each person\\nto whom it is directed to attend and give testimony, and if appropriate, to produce specified books and records at a time and\\nplace therein specified.

The party to whom the subpoena is issued shall complete the subpoena\\nbefore service.\\n(2) Where the witness is located in a foreign country, a letter rogatory may be issued and served under the\\ncircumstances and in the manner provided in 28 U.S.C. 1781.\\n(f) Service—\\n(1) The party requesting issuance of a subpoena shall arrange for service.\\n(2) A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition or hearing may be served in any state,\\ncommonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia.

However, where the subpoena is issued on behalf of the\\nGovernment, payment need not be tendered in advance of attendance.\\n(3) The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be responsible for the payment of fees and mileage of the\\nwitness and of the officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such charges on demand may be deemed\\nby the Board as a sufficient ground for striking such evidence as the Board deems appropriate.\\n(g) Contumacy or Refusal to Obey a Subpoena—In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena by a person who\\nresides, is found, or transacts business within the jurisdiction of a United States District Court, the Board may apply to the\\nCourt through the Attorney General of the United States for an order requiring the person to appear before the Board to give\\ntestimony or produce evidence or both. Any failure of any such person to obey the order of the Court may be punished by the\\nCourt as a contempt thereof.\\nRule 23. Ex Parte Communications\\nNo member of the Board or of the Board’s staff shall entertain, nor shall any person directly or indirectly involved in an\\nappeal, submit to the Board or the Board’s staff, ex parte, any evidence, explanation, analysis, or advice, whether written or\\noral, regarding any matter at issue in an appeal.

The Contract Disputes Act (CDA), 41 U.S.C. 7105(g)(1), states that boards of contract appeals \"shall ... to the fullest\\nextent practicable provide informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of disputes\". Resolution of a dispute at the\\nearliest stage feasible, by the fastest and least expensive method possible, benefits both parties. To that end, the parties are\\nencouraged to consider Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedures for pre-claim and pre-final decision matters, as\\nwell as appeals pending before the Board. The Board may also conduct ADRs for any Federal agency. However, if the matter\\nis not pending before the Board under its CDA jurisdiction, any settlement may not be paid out of the Judgment Fund.\\n2. The ADR methods described in this Addendum are intended to suggest techniques that have worked in the past. Any\\nappropriate method that brings the parties together in settlement, or partial settlement, of their disputes is a good method.\\nThe ADR methods listed are not intended to preclude the parties\\' use of other ADR techniques that do not require the Board\\'s\\nparticipation, such as settlement negotiations, fact-finding conferences or procedures, mediation, or minitrials not involving\\nuse of the Board\\'s personnel. Any method, or combination of methods, including one that will result in a binding decision,\\nmay be selected by the parties without regard to the dollar amount in dispute.\\n3. The parties must jointly request ADR procedures at the Board. The request must be approved by the Board. The\\nBoard may also schedule a conference to explore the desirability and selection of an ADR method and related procedures.\\n1-12\\n\\nPART 1 —CHARTER\\nIf an ADR involving the Board\\'s participation is requested and approved by the Board, a Neutral will be appointed. If an\\nAdministrative Judge has already been assigned to an appeal, the same judge will normally be assigned to be the Neutral in\\nan ADR. If an Administrative Judge has not yet been assigned to the appeal, or if the subject of the ADR is a matter pending\\nbefore the contracting officer prior to any appeal, the Board will appoint an Administrative Judge to be the Neutral. In such\\ninstances, as well as situations in which the parties prefer that an assigned Administrative Judge not be appointed to serve\\nas the Neutral, the parties may submit a list of at least three preferred Administrative Judges and the Board will endeavor to\\naccommodate their preferences.\\n4. To facilitate full, frank and open discussion and presentations, any Neutral who has participated in a non-binding\\nADR procedure that has failed to resolve the underlying dispute will be recused from further participation in the matter unless\\nthe parties expressly agree otherwise in writing and the Board concurs. Further, the recused Neutral will not discuss the\\nmerits of the dispute or substantive matters involved in the ADR proceedings with other Board personnel.\\n5. Written material prepared specifically for use in an ADR proceeding, oral presentations made at an ADR proceeding,\\nand all discussions in connection with such proceedings between the parties and the Neutral are confidential and, unless\\notherwise specifically agreed by the parties, inadmissible as evidence in any pending or future Board proceeding involving\\nthe parties or matter in dispute. However, evidence otherwise admissible before the Board is not rendered inadmissible\\nbecause of its use in the ADR proceeding.\\n6. The ADR method and the procedures and requirements implementing the ADR method will be prescribed by the\\nwritten agreement of the parties and approved by the Board. ADR methods can be used successfully at any stage of the\\nlitigation.\\n7. The following are examples of ADR methods commonly used at the Board:\\n(a) Nonbinding—\\nMediations: A Neutral is an Administrative Judge who will not normally hear or have any formal or informal decision-\\nmaking authority in the matter and who is appointed for the purpose of facilitating settlement. In many circumstances,\\nsettlement can be fostered by a frank, in-depth discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each party\\'s position with the\\nNeutral. The agenda for meetings with the Neutral will be flexible to accommodate the requirements of the case. To further\\nthe settlement effort, the Neutral may meet with the parties either jointly or individually. A Neutral’s recommendations are\\nnot binding on the parties. When this method is selected, the ADR agreement must contain a provision in which the parties\\nand counsel agree not to subpoena the Neutral in any legal action or administrative proceeding of any kind to produce any\\nnotes or documents related to the ADR proceeding or to testify concerning any such notes or documents or concerning his/her\\nthoughts or impressions.\\n(b) Binding—\\nSummary Proceeding With Binding Decision: A summary proceeding with binding decision is a procedure whereby the\\nresolution of the appeal is expedited and the parties try their appeal informally before an Administrative Judge. A binding\\n\"bench\" decision may be issued upon conclusion of the proceeding, or a binding summary written decision will be issued\\nby the judge no later than ten days following the later of conclusion of the proceeding or receipt of a transcript. The parties\\nmust agree in the ADR agreement that all decisions, rulings, and orders by the Board under this method shall be final,\\nconclusive, not appealable, and may not be set aside, except for fraud. All such decisions, rulings, and orders will have\\nno precedential value. Prehearing, hearing, and post-hearing procedures and rules applicable to appeals generally will be\\nmodified or eliminated to expedite resolution of the appeal.\\n(c) Other Agreed Methods—\\nThe parties and the Board may agree upon other informal methods, binding or nonbinding that are structured and tailored\\nto suit the requirements of the individual case.\\n8. The above-listed ADR procedures are intended to shorten and simplify the Board\\'s more formalized procedures.\\nGenerally, if the parties resolve their dispute by agreement, they benefit in terms of cost and time savings and maintenance\\nor restoration of amicable relations. The Board will not view the parties\\' participation in ADR proceedings as a sign of\\nweakness. Any method adopted for dispute resolution depends upon both parties having a firm, good faith commitment to\\nresolve their differences. Absent such intention, the best structured dispute resolution procedure is unlikely to be successful.\\nARMED SERVICES BOARD OF CONTRACT APPEALS\\n1-13\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n1-14\\n\\nPART 1 -CHARTER\\nPart 1 -Charter\\n1.

The WAWF RR is the electronic\\nequivalent of the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report (MIRR). The WAWF Energy RR is the electronic\\nequivalent of the DD Form 250 for overland shipments and DD Form 250-1, Tanker/Barge Material Inspection and Receiving\\nReport, for waterborne shipments. The WAWF RRR is the electronic equivalent of the DD Form 250 for repair, maintenance,\\nor overhaul of Government-furnished property.\\n(b) The use of the DD Form 250 series documents is on an exception basis (see DFARS (a)) because use of the WAWF\\nRR is now required by most DoD contracts. WAWF provides for electronic preparation and documentation of acceptance of\\nsupplies and services, and electronic invoicing. In addition WAWF allows the printing of a RR that can be used as a packing\\nlist or when a signed copy is required.\\nF-102 Applicability.\\n(a) DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports, requires payment requests\\nand receiving reports using WAWF in nearly all cases.\\n(b) When DoD provides quality assurance or acceptance services for non-DoD activities, prepare a MIRR using the\\ninstructions in this appendix, unless otherwise specified in the contract.\\nF-103 Use.\\n(a) The WAWF RR, WAWF RRR, and the DD Form 250 are multipurpose reports used—\\n(1) To provide evidence of Government contract quality assurance at origin or destination;\\n(2) To provide evidence of acceptance at origin, destination, or other;\\n(3) For packing lists;\\n(4) For receiving;\\n(5) For shipping;\\n(6) As a contractor invoice (the WAWF RR, WAWF RRR, or DD Form 250 alone cannot be used as an invoice,\\nhowever the option exists to create an invoice from the Receiving Report or a Combo (Invoice and Receiving Report) both of\\nwhich minimize data entry); and\\n(7) As commercial invoice support.\\n(b) Do not use the WAWF RR, WAWF RRR, or the DD Form 250 for shipments—\\n(1) By subcontractors, unless the subcontractor is shipping directly to the Government; or\\n(2) Of contract inventory. The WAWF Property Transfer document should be used for this type of shipment. Training\\nfor the preparation of this document type is available at https://wawftraining.eb.mil, under the Property Transfer and Receipt\\nsection.\\n(c) The contractor prepares the WAWF RR, WAWF RRR, or the DD Form 250, except for entries that an authorized\\nGovernment representative is required to complete. When using a paper DD Form 250, the contractor shall furnish sufficient\\ncopies of the completed form, as directed by the Government representative.\\n(d) Use the WAWF Energy RR or the DD Form 250-1:\\n(1) For bulk movements of petroleum products by tanker or barge to cover—\\n(i) Origin or destination acceptance of cargo; or\\n(ii) Shipment or receipt of Government owned products.\\n(2) To send quality data to the point of acceptance in the case of origin inspection on FOB destination deliveries or\\npreinspection at product source. Annotate the forms with the words “INSPECTED FOR QUALITY ONLY.”\\n(e) In addition to the above uses, the WAWF RR and WAWF RRR provide additional functionality, not provided by the\\npaper DD Form 250 that complies with the following requirements:\\n(1) Item Unique Identification (IUID), when the clause at DFARS , Item Unique Identification and Valuation is used\\nin the contract, reporting of IUID data is required. WAWF captures the IUID data and forwards the data to the IUID registry\\nafter acceptance. WAWF shall be used to report Unique Item Identifiers (UIIs) at the line item level, unless an exception to\\nWAWF applies, and can also be used to report UIIs embedded at the line item level.\\n1-1\\n\\nF-104\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\n(2) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), when the clause at DFARS , Radio Frequency Identification, is used in\\nthe contract, WAWF will capture the RFID information and forward the data to the receiving location. Using WAWF is the\\nonly way a contractor can comply with the clause to furnish RFID data via an Advance Shipping Notice (ASN). The RFID\\ninformation may be added at time of submission, or via the WAWF Pack Later functionality after acceptance.\\n(3) Reporting of Government-furnished property, when the clause at DFARS , Reporting of Government-Furnished\\nProperty, is used in the contract, use of the WAWF RRR will capture the shipment of Government-furnished property items\\nafter acceptance of repair services and forward the data to the IUID registry. WAWF is the only way a contractor can report\\nthe transfer of Government-furnished property items in the IUID registry.\\nF-104 Application.\\n(a) WAWF RR and DD Form 250.\\n(1) Use the WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for delivery of contract line, subline, exhibit line, or exhibit subline items. Do\\nnot use the WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for those exhibit line or exhibit subline items on a DD Form 1423, Contract Data\\nRequirements List, that indicate no DD Form 250 is required.\\n(2) If the shipped to, marked for, shipped from, mode of shipment, contract quality assurance and acceptance data are\\nthe same for more than one shipment made on the same day under the same contract, contractors may prepare one WAWF RR\\nor DD Form 250 to cover all such shipments.\\n(3) If the volume of the shipment precludes the use of a single car, truck, or other vehicle, prepare a separate WAWF\\nRR or DD Form 250 for the contents of each vehicle.\\n(4) When a shipment is consigned to an Air Force activity and the shipment includes items of more than one Federal\\nsupply class (FSC) or material management code (MMC), prepare a separate WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for items of each\\nof the FSCs or MMCs in the shipment. However, the cognizant Government representative may authorize a single WAWF\\nRR or DD Form 250, listing each of the FSCs or MMCs included in the shipment on a separate continuation sheet. The MMC\\nappears as a suffix to the national stock number applicable to the item.\\n(5) Consolidation of Petroleum Shipments on a Single WAWF RR or DD Form 250.\\n(i) Contiguous United States. Contractors may consolidate multiple car or truck load shipments of petroleum made\\non the same day, to the same destination, against the same contract line item, on one WAWF RR or DD Form 250. To permit\\nverification of motor deliveries, assign each load a load number which can be identified to the shipment number in Block\\n2 of the DD Form 250. Include a shipping document (commercial or Government) with each individual load showing as a\\nminimum—\\n(A) The shipper;\\n(B) Shipping point;\\n(C) Consignee;\\n(D) Contract and line item number;\\n(E) Product identification;\\n(F) Gross gallons (bulk only);\\n(G) Loading temperature (bulk only);\\n(H) American Petroleum Institute gravity (bulk only);\\n(I) Identification of carrier\\'s equipment;\\n(J) Serial number of all seals applied; and\\n(K) Signature of supplier\\'s representative.\\nWhen acceptance is at destination, the receiving activity retains the shipping document(s) to verify the entries on\\nthe consignee copy of the DD Form 250 forwarded by the contractor (reference F-401, Table 1) before signing Block 21b.\\n(ii) Overseas. The same criteria as for contiguous United States applies, except the consolidation period may be\\nextended, if acceptable to the receiving activity, shipping activity, Government finance office, and the authorized Government\\nrepresentative having cognizance at the contractor\\'s facility. In addition, the contractor may include more than one contract\\nline item in each WAWF RR or DD Form 250 if the shipped to, marked for, shipped from, mode of shipment, contract quality\\nassurance, and acceptance data are the same for all line items.\\n(6) Consolidation of Coal Shipments on a Single WAWF RR or DD 250. Contractors may consolidate multiple railcar\\nor truck shipments of coal made on the same day, to the same destination, against the same contract line items, on one WAWF\\nRR or DD 250. To permit verification of truck deliveries, assign each load a load number which can be identified to the\\nshipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250 and the analytical test report. Include a commercial shipping document\\nwith each individual truck load showing as a minimum—\\n1-2\\n\\nPART 1 -INTRODUCTION\\nF-104\\n(i) The shipper;\\n(ii) The name or names;\\n(iii) Location and shipping point of the mine or mines from which the coal originates;\\n(iv) The contract number;\\n(v) The exact size of the coal shipped; and\\n(vi) A certified weighmaster\\'s certification of weight for the truckload.\\nInclude a waybill with each rail shipment showing the identical information. To permit verification of rail\\ndeliveries, identify each railcar number comprising the shipment to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250 and\\nthe analytical test report. When acceptance is at destination, the receiving activity must retain the shipping document(s) to\\nverify the entries on the consignee copy of the DD Form 250.\\n(b) WAWF RRR or DD Form 250. Use as in paragraph (a) of this section for delivery of services for repair, overhaul, or\\nmaintenance.\\n(c) WAWF Energy RR or the DD Form 250-1.\\n(1) Use a separate form for each tanker or barge cargo loaded.\\n(2) The contractor may report more than one barge in the same tow on a single form if on the same contract and\\nconsigned to the same destination.\\n(3) When liftings involve more than one contract, prepare separate forms to cover the portion of cargo loaded on each\\ncontract.\\n(4) Prepare a separate form for each product or grade of product loaded.\\n(5) Use a separate document for each tanker or barge cargo and each grade of product discharged.\\n(6) For discharge, the contractor may report more than one barge in the same tow on a single form if from the same\\nloading source.\\n1-3\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n1-4\\n\\nPART 2 -CONTRACT QUALITY ASSURANCE ON SHIPMENTS BETWEEN CONTRACTORS\\nF-201\\nPart 2 -CONTRACT QUALITY ASSURANCE\\nON SHIPMENTS BETWEEN CONTRACTORS\\nF-201 Procedures.\\nFollow the procedures at PGI F-201 for evidence of required Government contract quality assurance at a subcontractor’s\\nfacility.\\n2-1\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n2-2\\n\\nPART 3 -PREPARATION OF THE WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) RECEIVING REPORT (RR), WAWF REPARABLE RECEIVING REPORT (WAWF RRR), AND WAWF ENERGY RR\\nF-301\\nPart 3 -PREPARATION OF THE WIDE AREA WORKFLOW\\n(WAWF) RECEIVING REPORT (RR), WAWF REPARABLE\\nRECEIVING REPORT (WAWF RRR), AND WAWF ENERGY RR\\nF-301 Preparation instructions.\\n(a) General.\\n(1) Preparation instructions and training for the WAWF RR are available at https://wawftraining.eb.mil. The\\ninstructions on preparing a WAWF RR are part of the Vendor Training section.\\n(2) Prime contractors can direct subcontractors to prepare and submit documents in WAWF by giving their\\nsubcontractors access to WAWF via the creation of a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) extension to the prime\\nCAGE.\\n(3) If the contract is in Electronic Data Access (EDA) (DoD’s contract repository), then the WAWF system will\\nautomatically populate all available and applicable contract data.\\n(i) When source acceptance is required, WAWF will populate the “Inspect By” with the “Admin by” Department of\\nDefense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC). The vendor shall change the DoDAAC if Government Source Inspection (GSI)\\nis performed at other than the “Admin By.”\\n(ii) Any fields that have been pre-filled may be changed.\\n(iii) WAWF will also verify that CAGE codes are valid and active in the System for Award Management (SAM),\\nand that DoDAACs and Military Assistance Program Address Codes (MAPACs) are valid in Defense Automatic Addressing\\nSystem (DAAS).\\n(4) WAWF will populate the address information for CAGE codes, DODAACs, and MAPACs from SAM and DAAS.\\nThese sites are the DoD definitive sources for address information. Any fields that have been pre-filled may be changed or\\nadditional information added.\\n(5) Do not include classified information in WAWF.\\n(b) Completion instructions.\\n(1) CONTRACT NO/DELIVERY ORDER NO.\\n(i) For stand-alone contracts, enter the 13-position alpha-numeric basic Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID)\\nof the contract. For task and delivery orders numbered in accordance with FAR 4.1603 and DFARS 204.1603, enter the\\n13-character order number. The contract or agreement number under which the order was placed may be omitted from the\\nWAWF RR. Alternatively, the contractor may choose to enter the contract number on the WAWF RR in addition to the 13-\\ncharacter order number. If the order has only a four-position alpha-numeric call or order serial number, enter both the 13-\\nposition basic contract PIID and the four-position order number.\\n(ii) Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this appendix, do not enter supplementary numbers used in\\nconjunction with basic PIIDs to identify—\\n(A) Modifications of contracts and agreements;\\n(B) Modifications to calls or orders; or\\n(C) Document numbers representing contracts written between contractors.\\n(iii) When shipping instructions are furnished and shipment is made before receipt of the confirming contract\\nmodification (SF 30, Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract), enter a comment in the Misc. Info Tab to this\\neffect. This will appear in the Comments section of the printed WAWF RR.\\n(2) SHIPMENT NO.\\n(i) The shipment number format requires first three data positions to be alpha, fourth position alpha-numeric and\\nlast three positions numeric, e.g., DFAR001 or DAR0001. Any document used as a packing list must include the shipment\\nnumber information.\\n(A) The prime contractor shall control and assign the shipment number prefix. The shipment number shall consist\\nof three alphabetic characters for each “Shipped From” address. The shipment number prefix shall be different for each\\n“Shipped From” address and shall remain constant throughout the life of the contract. The prime contractor may assign\\nseparate prefixes when shipments are made from different locations within a facility identified by one “Shipped From”\\naddress.\\n(B) Number the first shipment 0001 for shipments made under the contract or contract and order number from\\neach “Shipped From” address, or shipping location within the “Shipped From” address. Consecutively number all subsequent\\n3-1\\n\\nF-301\\nDEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION\\nshipments with the identical shipment number prefix. While shipments should be created sequentially they can be released\\nand accepted out of sequence.\\n(1) Use alpha-numeric serial numbers when more than 9,999 numbers are required. Serially assign alpha-\\nnumeric numbers with the alpha in the first position (the letters I and O shall not be used) followed by the three-position\\nnumeric serial number. Use the following alpha-numeric sequence:\\nA000 through A999 (10,000 through 10,999)\\nB000 through B999 (11,000 through 11,999)\\nZ000 through Z999 (34,000 through 34,999)\\n(2) When this series is completely used, the shipment number prefix will have to be changed when the\\nseries is completely used. WAWF will not allow duplicate shipment numbers to be created against a contract or contract and\\ndelivery order.\\n(ii) Reassign the shipment number of the initial shipment where a “Replacement Shipment” is involved (see paragraph\\n(b)(16)(iv)(F) of this appendix).\\n(iii) The prime contractor shall control deliveries and on the final shipment of the contract shall end the shipment\\nnumber with a “Z.” Where the final shipment is from other than the prime contractor\\'s plant, the prime contractor may elect\\neither to—\\n(A) Direct the subcontractor making the final shipment to end that shipment number with a “Z”; or\\n(B) Upon determination that all subcontractors have completed their shipments, to correct the DD Form 250 (see\\nF-304) covering the final shipment made from the prime contractor\\'s plant by addition of a “Z” to that shipment number.\\n(iv) Contractors follow the procedures in F-305 to use commercial invoices.\\n(3) DATE SHIPPED. Enter the date the shipment is released to the carrier or the date the services are completed. If the\\nshipment will be released after the date of contract quality assurance and/or acceptance, enter the estimated date of release.\\nWhen the date is estimated, enter an “E” or select an \"E\" from the drop down menu in the “Estimated” block after the date.\\nDo not delay submission of the WAWF RR for lack of entry of the actual shipping date. Correction of the WAWF RR is not\\nrequired to show the actual shipping date (see F-303). Once the document is submitted the shipment date cannot be changed.\\n(4) B/L TCN. When applicable, enter—\\n(i) The commercial or Government bill of lading number after “B/L;” WAWF provides the capability to separately\\nand correctly identify the Government Bill of Lading (GBL) from a Commercial Bill of Lading (CBL). An authorized user\\nwill select whether the entered bill of lading number is either a GBL number or a CBL number.\\n(ii) The transportation control number must be a 17 alpha/numeric digit min/max field, and WAWF provides the\\ncapability to enter two secondary transportation tracking numbers.\\n(5) LINE HAUL MODE. Select the Line Haul Mode of Shipment code from a drop down menu in WAWF.\\n(6) INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE POINT. Enter an “S” for Origin or “D” for Destination. In addition to “S”\\nand “D,” WAWF allows acceptance at Other (O). For purposes of conforming to contract, \"O\" is equivalent to \"D\". In\\nWAWF, destination acceptance is performed by the “Ship to” DODAAC organization and “Other” permits the acceptance of\\ndestination documents at a location other than the “Ship to.” The goods or services will be shipped to one location and the\\npaperwork will be routed to another location for the actual acceptance.\\n(7) PRIME CONTRACTOR/CODE. Enter the prime CAGE code to which the contract was awarded.\\n(8) ADMINISTERED BY/CODE. Enter the DoDAAC code of the contract administration office cited in the contract.\\n(9) SHIPPED FROM/CODE\\n(i) Enter the CAGE or DoDAAC code of the “Shipped From” location.

A copy\\nof the record which formed the basis for the decision by the debarring and suspending official will be made available to the\\ncontractor. If there is a reason to withhold from the contractor any portion of the record, the contractor will be informed of\\nwhat is withheld and the reasons for such withholding.\\n-1\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n-2\\n\\nH-102\\nH-102 Nature of proceeding.\\nThere are two distinct proceedings which may be involved in the suspension or debarment process. The first is the\\npresentation of matters in opposition to the suspension or proposed debarment by the contractor. The second is fact-finding\\nwhich occurs only in cases in which the contractor’s presentation of matters in opposition raises a genuine dispute over\\none or more material facts. In a suspension action based upon an indictment or in a proposed debarment action based upon\\na conviction or civil judgment, there will be no fact-finding proceeding concerning the matters alleged in the indictment,\\nor the facts underlying the convictions or civil judgment. However, to the extent that the proposed action stems from the\\ncontractor’s affiliation with an individual or firm indicted or convicted, or the subject of a civil judgment, fact-finding is\\npermitted if a genuine dispute of fact is raised as to the question of affiliation as defined in FAR 9.403.\\n-1\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n-2\\n\\nH-103\\nH-103 Presentation of matters in opposition.\\n(a) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), matters in opposition may be presented in person, in writing, or\\nthrough a representative. Matters in opposition may be presented through any combination of the foregoing methods, but\\nif a contractor desires to present matters in person or through a representative, any written material should be delivered at\\nleast 5 working days in advance of the presentation. Usually, all matters in opposition are presented in a single proceeding. A\\ncontractor who becomes aware of a pending indictment or allegations of wrongdoing that the contractor believes may lead to\\nsuspension or debarment action may contact the debarring and suspending official or designee to provide information as to\\nthe contractor’s present responsibility.\\n(b) An in-person presentation is an informal meeting, nonadversarial in nature. The debarring and suspending official\\nand/or other agency representatives may ask questions of the contractor or its representative making the presentation. The\\ncontractor may select the individuals who will attend the meeting on the contractor’s behalf; individual respondents or\\nprincipals of a business firm respondent may attend and speak for themselves.\\n(c) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), the contractor may submit matters in opposition within 30 days\\nfrom receipt of the notice of suspension or proposed debarment.\\n(d) The opportunity to present matters in opposition to debarment includes the opportunity to present matters concerning\\nthe duration of the debarment.\\n-1\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n-2\\n\\nH-104\\nH-104 Fact-finding.\\n(a) The debarring and suspending official will determine whether the contractor’s presentation has raised a genuine dispute\\nof material fact(s). If the debarring and suspending official has decided against debarment or continued suspension, or the\\nprovisions of FAR 9.4 preclude fact-finding, no fact-finding will be conducted. If the debarring and suspending official has\\ndetermined a genuine dispute of material fact(s) exists, a designated fact-finder will conduct the fact-finding proceeding.\\nThe proceeding before the fact-finder will be limited to a finding of the facts in dispute as determined by the debarring and\\nsuspending official.\\n(b) The designated fact-finder will establish the date for a fact-finding proceeding, normally to be held within 45 working\\ndays of the contractor’s presentation of matters in opposition. An official record will be made of the fact-finding proceeding.\\n(c) The Government’s representative and the contractor will have an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the facts\\nat issue. The contractor may appear in person or through a representative in the fact-finding proceeding.\\n(d) Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern fact-finding. Hearsay evidence\\nmay be presented and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finder.\\n(e) Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses will be reminded of the official nature of the proceeding and that any false\\ntestimony given is subject to criminal prosecution. Witnesses are subject to cross-examination.\\n-1\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n-2\\n\\nH-105\\nH-105 Timing requirements.\\nAll timing requirements set forth in these procedures may be extended by the debarring and suspending official for good\\ncause.\\n-1\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n-2\\n\\nH-106\\nH-106 Subsequent to fact-finding.\\n(a) Written findings of fact will be prepared by the fact-finder as mandated by FAR 9.406-3(d)(2)(i) and 9.407-3(d)(2)\\n(i).\\n(b) The fact-finder will determine the disputed fact(s) by a preponderance of the evidence. A copy of the findings of fact\\nwill be provided to the debarring and suspending official, the Government’s representative, and the contractor.\\n(c) The debarring and suspending official will determine whether to continue the suspension or to debar the contractor\\nbased upon the entire administrative record, including the findings of fact.\\n(d) Prompt written notice of the debarring and suspending official’s decision will be sent to the contractor and any\\naffiliates involved, in compliance with FAR 9.406-3(e) and 9.407-3(d)(4).\\n-1\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n-2\\n\\nRevised March 26, 2024\\nAPPENDIX I - POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR\\nTHE DOD PILOT MENTOR-PROTEGE PROGRAM\\nSec.\\nI-100\\nPurpose.\\nI-101\\nDefinitions.\\nI-102\\nParticipant eligibility.\\nI-103\\nIncentives for mentors.\\nI-104\\nSelection of protege firms.\\nI-105\\nMentor approval process.\\nI-106\\nDevelopment of mentor-protege agreements.\\nI-107\\nElements of a mentor-protege agreement.\\nI-108\\nSubmission and approval of mentor-protege agreements.\\nI-109\\nReimbursable agreements.\\nI-110\\nCredit agreements.\\nI-110.1\\nProgram provisions applicable to credit agreements.\\nI-110.2\\nCredit adjustments.\\nI-111\\nAgreement terminations.\\nI-112\\nReporting requirements.\\nI-112.1\\nReporting requirements applicable to Individual Subcontract\\nReports (ISR), Summary Subcontract Reports (SSR) and Standard\\nForms 294.\\nI-112.2\\nProgram specific reporting requirements.\\nI-113\\nPerformance reviews.\\nI-1\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\nI-2\\n\\nRevised March 26, 2024\\nI-100\\nI-100 Purpose.\\n(a) This appendix implements the DoD Mentor-Protégé Program (referred to as the Program) authorizedunder  10 U.S.C.\\n4902.

Provision of progress payments by a mentor firm to a protege firm at a rate other than\\nthe customary rate for the firm must be implemented in accordance with FAR 32.504(c).\\n(4) Advance payments under such subcontracts. The mentor firm must administer advance payments in accordance\\nwith FAR subpart 32.4 .\\n(5) Loans.\\n(6) Assistance that the mentor firm obtains for the protege firm from one or more of the following:\\n(i) Small Business Development Centers established pursuant to section 21 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.\\n648).\\n(ii) Entities providing procurement technical assistance pursuant to 10 U.S.C.

The purpose of the advance agreement is to establish the accounting treatment of the costs of the developmental\\nassistance pursuant to the mentor-protege agreement prior to the incurring of any costs by the mentor firm. An advance\\nagreement is an attempt by both the Government and the mentor firm to avoid possible subsequent dispute based on questions\\nrelated to reasonableness, allocability, or allowability of the costs of developmental assistance under the Program. Absent an\\nadvance agreement, mentor firms are advised to establish the accounting treatment of such costs and to address the need for\\nany changes to their cost accounting practices that may result from the implementation of a mentor-protege agreement, prior\\nto incurring any costs, and irrespective of whether costs will be reimbursed or credited.\\n(f) Developmental assistance provided under an approved mentor-protege agreement is distinct from, and must\\nnot duplicate, any effort that is the normal and expected product of the award and administration of the mentor firm\\'s\\nsubcontracts. Costs associated with the latter must be accumulated and charged in accordance with the contractor\\'s approved\\naccounting practices; they are not considered developmental assistance costs eligible for either credit or reimbursement under\\nthe Program.\\n(g) The agreement shall demonstrate, through its execution, how it will contribute to the overall mission of DoD and/or fill\\nor address an identified critical gap or vulnerability.
